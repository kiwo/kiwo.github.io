        <p>Windows 8 / Windows RT / Windows Store all arrived in October 2012.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve decided to take a shot on writing a commercial application for this new platform. And that&#39;s how Poker Money app appeared.</p>
<p>Here are the links to it:</p>

<p>Poker Money is a basic tool for tracking online poker results, which supports all game types for the two major poker rooms: PokerStars and FullTiltPoker.</p>
<p>Here is a sample screen:

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Today I want to give a note about two more online courses that I completed.</p>
<p>The last one (10 weeks in September-November) was called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compfinance">Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics</a> and was lead by Eric Zivot from University of Washington. First of all, it was the most intense course out of all that I took to date. Every of 10 weeks we had about 3-4 hours of videos + homework. The course material was mostly about maths and statistics, and less about application in economics. However, some concepts were new to me and sounded very interesting.</p>
<p>I scored about 95% on all tests and exams (they were relatively easy comparing to video material). But unfortunately, I got no certificate or even course record for this! It seems that University of Washington did not allow Coursera to issue such certificates and records... What a shame! I spent lots of time on it, and a record would be satisfactory. Please be careful if you take this course or other courses of UoW in the future.</p>
<p>However, I got another unexpected certificate. In June, I took a course called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/hci">Human-Computer Interaction</a> about user interface design concepts and approaches. I started it with a big delay because of my vacation, so I thought I wouldn&#39;t score enough for a certificate. But I was wrong! I got the certificate 6 months after the course ended:
<img src="/2012/12/26/one-certificate-missing-one-received-unexpectedly/hci.jpg" alt="HCI certificate"></p>
<p>The course was short but useful. I wish there would be an extension course, which would cover more details on the topic.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I&#39;ve recently received a statement of accomplishment document for <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" title="Coursera">Coursera</a>&#39;s online <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/introfinance" title="Introduction to Finance class">Introduction to Finance class</a> that I took in July-September this year.</p>
<p><img src="/2012/11/01/finance-class-at-coursera/finance.jpg" alt="Finance"></p>
<p>The course was lead by prof. Gautam Kaul from University of Michigan. The level of lectures was really introductory, the pace was very slow (too slow for me, even watching x1.5 speed). You could learn about basic finance principles like time value of money, calculating cash flows and discounted values, about stocks and bonds, and risk/return relations.</p>
<p>I liked a lot the assignment tests, which were much stronger and solid then the examples in lectures. They were challenging most of the time, so I&#39;m glad I managed to get 100% score in the end :)</p>
<p>Recommended for anyone who has no idea about what finance is about, but not for experienced students.</p>

<p><img src="/2012/10/29/gamification-class-at-coursera/gamification.jpg" alt="Gamification certificate" title="Gamification certificate"></p>
<p>The course was lead by prof. Kevin Werbach from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. He told us about applying game techniques to non-game world problems: business, social etc. In essence, it&#39;s on how to add FUN to processes, that are not supposed to be fun at all. Which is really cool. I loved both informative and well-producted lectures, and peer-reviewed assignments that appeared to be... fun :)</p>
<p>Want to know why Stackoverflow and Foursquare are such a success? Come join this course next time!</p>
<p>I hope I&#39;ll have a chance to apply the ideas from the course in real life!</p>

    <h1><a href='/2012/09/02/use-fiddler-to-debug-urlfetch-requests-in-google-appengine'>Use Fiddler to debug urlfetch requests in Google AppEngine</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>In <a href="http://www.tripbenefit.com" title="TripBenefit.com - travel in St. Petersburg, Russia">TripBenefit</a> application, we use a lot of web crawling to get data from third-party websites. As the application works on top of Google AppEngine, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/urlfetch/fetchfunction?hl=ru" title="urlfetch.fetch() docs">urlfetch.fetch()</a> function is used to send HTTP requests and get responses.</p>
<p>Some crawling is not as easy as just a simple GET request, so we have to send specific POST data, cookies and HTTP headers. And all this needs to be debugged. <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com" title="Fiddler2 web debugging tool">Fiddler2</a> is the gold standard for web debugging tools, so I&#39;d like to use it in this case too. I.e. I want to see urlfetch requests displayed in Fiddler, while I&#39;m on development env.<strong>
</strong></p>
<p>However, to make it work, I have to make AppEngine run all fetch requests through the Fiddler&#39;s proxy: localhost:8888. As proxies aren&#39;t supported within Google production environment, it&#39;s not supported by development engine either. There&#39;s simply no such &#39;proxy&#39; parameter in urlfetch!</p>
<p>It seems that the only way to overcome this limitation is to modify the code of AppEngine development server. It isn&#39;t that tricky as it sounds! :)</p>
<p>Stop all your developmenet AppEngine instances. Go to your AppEngine folder, and then to \google\appengine\api. Edit urlfetch_stub.py (make a backup beforehand). Search for &quot;connection =&quot; line, something like</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs stylus"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> _CONNECTION_SUPPORTS_TIMEOUT:
  connection = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">connection_class</span><span class="hljs-params">(host, timeout=deadline)</span></span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">else</span>:
  connection = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">connection_class</span><span class="hljs-params">(host)</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Substitute it with </p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs stylus">connection = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">connection_class</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-string">'127.0.0.1'</span>, <span class="hljs-number">8888</span>)</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Then, search for &quot;connection.request&quot; method call similar to</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs nimrod">connection.request(<span class="hljs-keyword">method</span>, full_path, payload, adjusted_headers)
</code></pre><p>and insert another line before it:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ini"><span class="hljs-setting">full_path = <span class="hljs-value">protocol + <span class="hljs-string">"://"</span> + host + full_path</span></span>
</code></pre><p>Done! After you run the dev server and Fiddler2, you should be able to see urlfetch requests in web debugger. Have a nice debugging session!</p>
