    <h1><a href='/2017/01/my-praise-of-advent-of-code-2016'>My Praise of Advent of Code 2016</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>During the last days of December I was pleasing my internal need for solving 
puzzles and tricky tasks by going through 
<a href="http://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code 2016</a> challenge.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: every day since December 1st to 25th, the site publishes 
a new brain teaser. They are all aligned into one story: the Bad Easter Bunny 
has stolen all the Chrismas gifts from Santa, and now you are the hero who 
should break into the Bunny&#39;s headquarters and save the gifts for the kids.</p>
<p>Having said that, each challenge is independent from the others, so you can 
solve them in arbitrary order if you want. </p>
<p><img src="/2017/01/my-praise-of-advent-of-code-2016/levelmap.png" alt="Advent Of Code Levels">
<em>Advent Calendar in dark ASCII</em></p>
<p>A puzzle consists of a description and an input data set associated with it.
The solution is typically represented as a number or a short string, so it
can be easily typed into the textbox. However, to get this solution you need to
implement a program: computing it manually is not feasible.</p>
<p>I started a bit late and got just the first 11 puzzles solved. Each puzzle 
is doable in one sitting, usually half-an-hour to a couple hours of work,
which is very nice.</p>
<p>Some problems are purely about the correctness of your solution. The most
engaging tasks were also computationally intensive, such that a straightforward
solution took too much time to run to completion. You need to find a
shortcut to make it faster, which is always fun.</p>
<p><img src="/2017/01/my-praise-of-advent-of-code-2016/solved.png" alt="Problem Solved!">
<em>You collect stars for providing the correct answers</em></p>
<p>Apart from generic joy and satisfaction that one gets from solving programming
challenges like these, I also consider it a good opportunity to try a
new programming language or a paradygm.</p>
<p>As I said, the tasks are relatively small, so you can feel the sense of
accomplishment quite often, even being not very familiar with the programming
language of choice.</p>
<p>There are many other people solving the same puzzles and also sharing their
solutions online. You can go and find the other implementations of a task
that you just solved, and compare it to your approach. That&#39;s the great way
to learn from other people, broaden your view and expose yourself to new
tricks, data structures and APIs.</p>
<p>I picked F# as my programming language for Advent of Code 2016. I chose to restrict
myself to immutable data structures and pure functions. And it played out really nice,
I am quite happy with speed of development, readability and performance of 
the code.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p><em>The post was published for 
<a href="https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2016/">F# Advent Calendar 2016</a>,
thus the examples are themed around the Christmas gifts.</em></p>
<p>This post is opening a series of articles about data processing
discipline called <strong>Stream Processing</strong>. </p>
<p>I describe stream processing from the developer perspective, using the 
following (rather unusual) angle:</p>
<ul>
<li>F# as the primary language</li>
<li>Concepts and principles are more important than frameworks and tools</li>
<li>Start with modeling the domain problem and then solve just the problems
that your domain has</li>
</ul>
<p>We begin the journey by introducing what stream processing is all about.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-and-why-s">What&#39;s and Why&#39;s</h2>
<p>There are several techniques to process data that are flowing into your
applications, and stream processing is one of them.</p>
<p>Stream processing is focused on the real-time processing of data 
continuously, concurrently, and in a record-by-record fashion. Stream 
processing is designed to analyze and act on live data flow, using 
&quot;continuous queries&quot; expressed in user code. Data is structured 
as a continuous stream of events over time:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/11/introducing-stream-processing-in-fsharp/eventflow.png" alt="Flow of events"></p>
<p>In contrast to some other approaches to reason about application
structure, stream processing concepts are drawn around the data structures,
flows and transformations rather than services or remote calls.</p>
<p>Although the approach is nothing new, it gained much more traction 
during the last years, especially in big data community. Products 
like <em>Storm</em>, <em>Kafka</em>, <em>Flink</em>, <em>Samza</em> (all under <em>Apache Foundation</em>), 
<em>Google Cloud Dataflow</em>, <em>Akka Streams</em> are popularizing the programming 
model and bringing the tools to make it reliable and scalable.</p>
<p>These products are born from the need to run data processing in 
massively distributed environments. They are all about scaling out
and solving or mitigating the issues of distributed systems which
are inherintly not reliable.</p>
<p>While this is a noble and mission-critical goal for internet-scale companies, most 
applications do not require such massive performances and scale.</p>
<p>There is something to be said for the domain-driven approach, when
an application is built around the main asset and burden of enterprise
systems: the core business logic. It may happen that you don&#39;t need
a general purpose framework with the lowest processing latency. Instead
your choice of tools might lean towards the cleanest code possible, tailored 
for your own needs, and maintainable over time.</p>
<p>Knowing the landscape can help you do the right trade-off.</p>
<p>The recent Stream Processing boom comes from <em>Apache</em> / <em>JVM</em> world. 
Unfortunately, stream processing frameworks and underlying concepts 
are mostly unfamiliar to <em>.NET</em> developers. </p>
<p>While <em>Azure Cloud</em> provides a managed service called <em>Azure Stream Analytics</em>,
the product is built around SQL-like language and is rather limited in
extensibility.</p>
<p>We will have a look at other options in .NET space in the further posts
of the series.</p>
<p>For now, I want to start filling the gap and introduce the basic concepts 
with F#. As a bonus, we are not limited by particular tools and 
implementations, but can start from the ground up.</p>
<h2 id="elements-of-a-stream">Elements of a Stream</h2>
<p>As I already mentioned above, people are doing stream processing for long 
time. In fact, if you receive events and then apply the transformation 
logic structured around a single event at a time - you are already 
doing stream processing. </p>
<p>Here is a simple picture which illustrates the elements of processing:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/11/introducing-stream-processing-in-fsharp/stage.png" alt="Stream Processing Stage"></p>
<p>The data <strong>Source</strong> is responsible for injection of events
into the pipeline. They are the input intergration points, typically they can
be persistent message queues, logs or subscription feeds.</p>
<p>A sequence of events in the same Source is called <strong>Stream</strong> (thus Stream Processing).
Streams have <strong>unbounded</strong> nature, which means that the amount 
of data points is not limited in size or time. There is no &quot;end&quot; of data: events
will potentially keep coming as long as the processing application is alive.</p>
<p>The high-level purpose of the <strong>Transformation</strong> is to extract
value from the events. That&#39;s where the business logic resides, and that&#39;s
where development effort goes to. Transformations can also be refered as Stages,
Flows, Tasks, Jobs and so on, depending on the context.</p>
<p>The most simple transformation like format conversion can be stateless.
However, other transformations will often use some kind of <strong>State Store</strong>,
as a means to</p>
<ul>
<li>Aggregate data from multiple events of the same stream</li>
<li>Correlate events from several streams</li>
<li>Enrich event data with external lookup data</li>
</ul>
<p>Data <strong>Sink</strong> represents the output of the pipeline, the place where the transformed, 
aggregated and enriched events end up at. </p>
<p>A Sink can be a database of any kind, which stores the processed data, ready
to be consumed by user queries and reports.</p>
<p>Another Sink can become a Source for another stream of events. This way
the series of transformations are sequenced together into <strong>Processing Pipelines</strong>
(or <strong>Topologies</strong>).</p>
<p>On the high-level, the pipelines can usually be represented as directed graphs,
with data streams in nodes and transformations in edges:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/11/introducing-stream-processing-in-fsharp/topology.png" alt="Stream Processing Pipeline"></p>
<p>In real-world applications, the pipelines can have lots of interconnected
elements and flow branches. We will start with a simplistic example.</p>
<h2 id="gift-count-pipeline">Gift Count Pipeline</h2>
<p>Word Count is the Hello World and TODO app of the data
processing world. Here are the reference implementations for 
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/examples/wordcount-example">Dataflow</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-examples/flink-examples-batch/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/examples/java/wordcount/WordCount.java">Flink</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm-starter/blob/master/src/jvm/storm/starter/WordCountTopology.java">Storm</a>.</p>
<p>To make it a bit more fun, we&#39;ll make a Gift Count pipeline out of it. 
The following image summarizes our Gift Count topology:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/11/introducing-stream-processing-in-fsharp/giftcount.png" alt="Gift Count Pipeline"></p>
<p>The pipeline consists of one source, one sink and two transformations. 
The input of the pipeline is the source of gift lists (each list is a comma
separated line of text).</p>
<p>The purpose of the processing is to tokenize gift lists into separate gifts,
and then count the occurances of each gift in the stream. The output
is written into a database sink, e.g. a key value store with gifts as keys and
amounts as values.</p>
<p>Note that while Split stage is stateless, the Count stage needs to keep some 
internal state to be able to aggregate data over multiple entries.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start thinking about the implementation. How do we model transformations
and pipelines in code?</p>
<h2 id="transformations">Transformations</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s how a transformation is typically represented in <em>Apache Storm</em>, the grand
daddy of Big Data Stream Processing systems (transformations are called 
<em>Bolts</em> in Storm, and code is Java):</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">TokenizerBolt</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">implements</span> <span class="hljs-title">IRichBolt</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">execute</span><span class="hljs-params">(Tuple input)</span> </span>{
        String wishlist = input.getString(<span class="hljs-number">0</span>);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(String gift: wishlist.split(<span class="hljs-string">", "</span>)) {
            collector.emit(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Values(gift));
        }
        collector.ack(input);
    }
    <span class="hljs-comment">// Other code is omitted</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Tokenizer is a class which implements a predefined interface with <code>execute</code>
method in it. The method accepts a container class <code>Tuple</code> from where
we can extract real data using position-based indexing. Something like a
<code>DataRow</code> from ADO.NET. The method does not return anything, but instead
calls an effect-ful method <code>emit</code>, passing a tuple to the next transformation
in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Clearly, there is some room for improvement here. We don&#39;t want to put our important
domain logic into amorphous functions of type <code>Collector -&gt; Tuple -&gt; unit</code>. Here
is what we can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use strong typing to see what function does based on its signature</li>
<li>Use pure functions to make them easy to test and reason about</li>
<li>Use domain-specific types with F# records and ADTs</li>
</ul>
<p>Our domain is very simple in Gift Count example. Still, we could describe <code>Gift</code>
type to restrict it to be lowercase, not empty etc. But for the sake of simplisity 
I&#39;ll limit it to one liner:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-title">Gift</span> </span>= string
</code></pre>
<p>Now, the type of the first transformation should be <code>string -&gt; Gift list</code>. So,
our transformation is based on a function </p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> tokenize (wishlist: string) =
  wishlist.ToLowerInvariant().Split(<span class="hljs-string">", "</span>)
  |&gt; List.ofArray
  |&gt; List.map (<span class="hljs-keyword">fun</span> x -&gt; x.Trim())
  |&gt; List.filter (<span class="hljs-keyword">fun</span> x -&gt; x.Length &gt; <span class="hljs-number">0</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>The counting transformation is modeled in a similar way. The base function
is of type <code>Gift list -&gt; (Gift * int) list</code> and is actually implemented as </p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> count xs = List.countBy id xs
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of using a real database, we will just print the counts to console.
So the last optional step for our examples will be to print out the counts
one by one. Here is a helper function:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> print (gift, count) = sprintf <span class="hljs-string">"%i %s"</span> count gift
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can tokenize and count the gifts in a single list. But how do we
aggregate data over time? Let&#39;s leave this to the pipelines.</p>
<h2 id="pipelines">Pipelines</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s have a look at a definition of a Storm pipeline (in Java):</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs java">TopologyBuilder builder = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> TopologyBuilder();
builder.setSpout(<span class="hljs-string">"line-reader"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> LineReaderSpout());
builder.setBolt(<span class="hljs-string">"gifts-spitter"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> GiftSpitterBolt()).shuffleGrouping(<span class="hljs-string">"line-reader"</span>);
builder.setBolt(<span class="hljs-string">"gift-counter"</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> GiftCounterBolt()).shuffleGrouping(<span class="hljs-string">"gifts-spitter"</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>There is a <code>Builder</code> class, which is capable to add Sources (<code>Spouts</code>) and Transformations
(<code>Bolts</code>) to the pipeline. But again, there&#39;s no type story here: the stages are linked
by name, and the types are just implementations of predefined interfaces.</p>
<p>Here is another example of the pipeline, now from <em>Google Dataflow SDK</em> (still Java):</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs java">Pipeline
    .create(options)
    .apply(TextIO.Read.from(<span class="hljs-string">"..."</span>))
    .apply(ParDo.named(<span class="hljs-string">"ExtractGifts"</span>).of(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> DoFn&lt;String, String&gt;() {
         <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">processElement</span><span class="hljs-params">(ProcessContext c)</span> </span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">/* Implements tokenizer */</span> }
    }))    
    .apply(Count.&lt;String&gt;perElement())
    .apply(MapElements.via(<span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> SimpleFunction&lt;KV&lt;String, Long&gt;, String&gt;() {
         <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> String <span class="hljs-title">apply</span><span class="hljs-params">(KV&lt;String, Long&gt; element)</span> </span>{ <span class="hljs-comment">/* Formats results */</span> }
    }))
    .apply(TextIO.Write.to(<span class="hljs-string">"..."</span>));
</code></pre>
<p>I consider this to be more descriptive. There is a clear flow of operations chained
together. The types are visible and checked at compile time.</p>
<p>How would we like to see this pipeline in F#? Our motivation example is going to
be the same processing applied to a normal F# list of wishlists (strings). The following
code snippet counts the gifts in wishlists and prints the result:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs">wishlists
|&gt; List.collect tokenize
|&gt; List.countBy id
|&gt; List.map print
|&gt; List.iter (Console.WriteLine)
</code></pre>
<p>My goal for the rest of the article will be to define a <code>Flow</code> module which would
enable me to write a Stream Processing pipeline in the same fashion. Here is the
target code:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs">sourceOfWishlists
|&gt; Flow.collect tokenize
|&gt; Flow.countBy id
|&gt; Flow.map print
|&gt; Flow.connectTo sinkForCounts
</code></pre>
<p>So, how do we implement something like this? Let&#39;s start with clarifying how
Source and Sink can be defined.</p>
<h2 id="source-and-sink">Source and Sink</h2>
<p>We declared the source of a stream to be unbounded, not limited in time
or event count. </p>
<p>However, the modern stream processing systems like <em>Flink</em> and <em>Dataflow</em> 
(both with ideas from <em>Apache Beam</em>) are trying to sit on two chairs at the same time by declaring
that bounded data sources are just sub-case of unbounded streams. If your
goal is to process a fixed batch of data, you could represent it as
one-by-one sequence of events.</p>
<p>Big Data world has a well known approach when batch processing and real time
stream processing are done in parallel, with separate tools and separate code base.
The approach is called <em>Lambda Architecture</em>. Beam is declaring this approach outdated,
offering a way to reuse streaming code and capacity also for bounded data workloads.</p>
<p>To follow this modern path, we will declare our <code>Source</code> as following:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-title">BoundedSource</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-title">'T</span>&gt; </span>= unit -&gt; <span class="hljs-attribute">'T</span> seq
<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-title">UnboundedSource</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-title">'T</span>&gt; </span>= (<span class="hljs-attribute">'T</span> -&gt; unit) -&gt; unit

<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-title">Source</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-title">'T</span>&gt; </span>= 
  | Bounded <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> BoundedSource&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'T</span>&gt;
  | Unbounded <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> UnboundedSource&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'T</span>&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><code>Source</code> is a generic discriminated union with two cases. <code>Bounded</code> case represents
a side effect-ful function, which returns a sequence of elements when called.
The argument of <code>unit</code> is there to delay the processing: we need to declare
sources long before they start to emit values.</p>
<p>The <code>Unbounded</code> case is a bit harder to understand. It accepts an action to be 
executed as the argument and returns nothing meaningful (<code>unit</code> again). You will
see a usage example later.</p>
<p>The <code>Sink</code> represents an action to happen at the end of pipeline. I&#39;ve made it
a discriminated union too, but with just one case:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-title">Sink</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-title">'T</span>&gt; </span>= | Action <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> (<span class="hljs-attribute">'T</span> -&gt; unit)
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we should be able to simulate an empty processing pipeline: directly connect 
a source to a sink. Let&#39;s start with bounded data:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> copyPipeline source sink =
  <span class="hljs-keyword">match</span> source, sink <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span>
  | Bounded b, Action a -&gt; b() |&gt; Seq.iter a
  | _ -&gt; failwith <span class="hljs-string">"Not supported yet"</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> gifts = seq [<span class="hljs-string">"Ball"</span>; <span class="hljs-string">"Train"</span>; <span class="hljs-string">"Doll"</span>]
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> giftBoundedSource = (<span class="hljs-keyword">fun</span>() -&gt; gifts) |&gt; Bounded

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> consoleSink = (<span class="hljs-keyword">fun</span> (s: string) -&gt; Console.WriteLine s) |&gt; Action

copyPipeline giftBoundedSource consoleSink
</code></pre>
<p>This code will print out all the gift names from the sequence. Now, let&#39;s extend it to
stream unbounded data. Before we can do that, let&#39;s introduce a helper class:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-title">Triggered</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-title">'T</span>&gt;</span>() = 
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> subscribers = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> List&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'T</span> -&gt; unit&gt;()
  <span class="hljs-keyword">member</span> this.DoNext x =
    subscribers.ForEach(<span class="hljs-keyword">fun</span> s -&gt; s x)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">member</span> this.Subscribe = subscribers.Add
</code></pre>
<p>An instance of such class keeps a mutable list of subscribers. Subscribers are
added by calling <code>Subscribe</code> method. Someone else can then call <code>DoNext</code> method,
and each subscriber will get an item every time.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how we can use it for unbounded data processing:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> copyPipeline source sink =
  <span class="hljs-keyword">match</span> source, sink <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span>
  | Bounded b, Action a -&gt; b() |&gt; Seq.iter a
  | Unbounded ub, Action a -&gt; ub a

<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> consoleSource = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Triggered&lt;string&gt;()
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> unboundedSource = consoleSource.Subscribe |&gt; Unbounded
copyPipeline unboundedSource consoleSink

Seq.initInfinite (<span class="hljs-keyword">fun</span> _ -&gt; Console.ReadLine())
|&gt; Seq.takeWhile ((&lt;&gt;) <span class="hljs-string">"q"</span>)
|&gt; Seq.iter consoleSource.DoNext
</code></pre>
<p>This little program will echo whatever you enter into the console until you type 
<code>q</code> to quit. That is an example of unbounded data: you can type as long as
you want, there is no hard limit.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Triggered</code> source is created.</li>
<li>Unbounded source is declared by subscribing to the trigger.</li>
<li>Our dummy pipeline links the source to the action of writing to console.</li>
<li>Every time a new line is entered, <code>DoNext</code> method of the trigger is called
and the data flows to the sink.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stop here and make sure you understand the example before going further.</p>
<h2 id="flow">Flow</h2>
<p>Now it&#39;s time to implement the contracts for the flow that we defined
in Gift Count example. The contract consists of two parts. The first part
is a generic interface which defines all the operations that we need:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-title">Runnable</span> </span>= unit -&gt; unit

<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-title">IFlow</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-title">'a</span>&gt; </span>=
  abstract <span class="hljs-keyword">member</span> Map&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'b</span>&gt; : (<span class="hljs-attribute">'a</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-attribute">'b</span>) -&gt; IFlow&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'b</span>&gt;
  abstract <span class="hljs-keyword">member</span> Collect&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'b</span>&gt; : (<span class="hljs-attribute">'a</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-attribute">'b</span> list) -&gt; IFlow&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'b</span>&gt;
  abstract <span class="hljs-keyword">member</span> CountBy&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'b</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">when</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">'b</span>: equality&gt; : (<span class="hljs-attribute">'a</span> -&gt; <span class="hljs-attribute">'b</span>) -&gt; IFlow&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'b</span> * int&gt;
  abstract <span class="hljs-keyword">member</span> To: Sink&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'a</span>&gt; -&gt; Runnable
</code></pre>
<p>Then we define a module which is just a wrapper around the interface to
enable F#-style API:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-keyword">module</span> Flow =
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> map&lt;'TI, 'TO&gt; (f: 'TI -&gt; 'TO) (flow: IFlow&lt;'TI&gt;) = flow.Map f
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> collect&lt;'TI, 'TO&gt; (f: 'TI -&gt; 'TO list) (flow: IFlow&lt;'TI&gt;) = flow.Collect f
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> countBy&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'T</span>, 'TK <span class="hljs-keyword">when</span> 'TK: equality&gt; (f: <span class="hljs-attribute">'T</span> -&gt; 'TK) (flow: IFlow&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'T</span>&gt;) = flow.CountBy f
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> connectTo&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'T</span>&gt; sink (flow: IFlow&lt;<span class="hljs-attribute">'T</span>&gt;) = flow.To sink
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> run (r: Runnable) = r()
</code></pre>
<p>Then, we just need an implementation of <code>IFlow</code> and a factory method to create
an initial instance of flow given a data source. </p>
<p>Now I&#39;d like to emphasize that there are multiple possible implementations 
of <code>IFlow</code> depending on the required properties for the pipeline. They might make
use of different libraries or frameworks, or be a naive simple implementation like
the one below, suitable for modeling and testing. </p>
<p>In fact, one of my implementations doesn&#39;t run the pipeline, but instead uses reflection
to build a visual graph of processing stages, to be used for documentation and discussion
purposes.</p>
<p>We will have a look at more advanced implementations in the further articles, but
for now here is a naive version:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-keyword">module</span> Runner =

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we started reasoning about low-latency processing 
pipelines from the domain logic point of view. We
tried to reuse well known F# idioms like ADTs and HOFs
to show how stream processing is not much different from other types
of applications.</p>
<p>Although this post is quite long by now, we just scratched the surface
of the stream processing. Here are some focus areas for the 
follow-ups:</p>
<ul>
<li>More complex pipeline topologies</li>
<li>State management</li>
<li>Concepts of time, windowing and out-of-order events</li>
<li>Reliability, retries and guarantees</li>
<li>Scaling out</li>
<li>Using 3rd parties for all of that</li>
<li>Documentation and formal analysis</li>
</ul>

    <h1><a href='/2016/11/event-sourcing-and-io-complexity'>Event Sourcing and IO Complexity</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p><strong>Event Sourcing</strong> is an approach, when an append-only store is used to record the full series of events that 
describe actions taken on a particular domain entity. This event store becomes the main source of truth 
to reconstruct the current state of the entity and its complete history.</p>
<p>In essence, that means that we store the log of all business events that occurred in the system, and then
we use them to make new decisions and produce new events. </p>
<h2 id="how-event-souring-works">How Event Souring Works</h2>
<p>Event Sourcing is usually used in combination with <strong>Command-Query Responsibility Segregation</strong>, when all writes 
to the event store are initiated by commands. </p>
<p>The following picture illustrates the storage and command handling:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/11/event-sourcing-and-io-complexity/event-store.png" alt="Event Store Command Handler"></p>
<p>Every time a new command comes in (1), the command handler understands 
which entity is affected and retrieves all the previous events from the store (2).</p>
<p>The handler aggregates the events and derives the current state of the entity (3). If command is valid given that 
state, the command handler produces a new event or several events (4), and writes them back to the event store (5).</p>
<h2 id="disk-space-usage">Disk Space Usage</h2>
<p>It&#39;s quite obvious that Event Sourcing requires more storage space than traditional approach of only storing 
the current state. The storage size is proportional to the total amount of events in the system, 
i.e. it&#39;s <code>O(n)</code> or <code>O(e * l)</code> where <code>e</code> is the count of entities in the system and <code>l</code> is the average 
amount of events per entity.</p>
<p>Here is the chart of disk space usage in a simplified situation of events of equal size:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/11/event-sourcing-and-io-complexity/disk-space.png" alt="Disk space simulation"></p>
<p>We saved 1000 events and consumed 1000 storage units. The disk space is cheap, so we are willing to take 
the trade-off of extra storage for the benefits that Event Sourcing provides.</p>
<h2 id="disk-io-usage">Disk IO Usage</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s look at how much IO operations we are going to perform over time. Let&#39;s say that reading or writing of
one event consumes one unit of IO capacity.</p>
<p>Every time a new event is received, we consume one write operation: it&#39;s still linear. The storage is append-only, 
so it makes sense that disk space and writes are essentially the same thing.</p>
<p>Reads are a different beast. Every time we receive a command, we need to perform <code>i</code> reads, where <code>i</code> 
is the amount of events so far for the entity. Let&#39;s have a look at several examples, each one is a
simulation of saving a thousand of new events.</p>
<p>In the <strong>first scenario</strong> we have a steady flow of incoming events. Events belong to different entities (aggregates) 
with <strong>10</strong> events per entity on average:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/11/event-sourcing-and-io-complexity/reads-low.png" alt="Reads for low amount of events per entity"></p>
<p>We can see that we do 5x more reads than writes. That is because for each event written we have to read 
all the previous events for the same entity, and on average there are 5 of them.</p>
<p>In the <strong>second scenario</strong> we receive the same amount of events in total. While most entities still have 
10 events on average, there is just one outlier entity which received <strong>100</strong> events, all in this time period.</p>
<p><img src="/2016/11/event-sourcing-and-io-complexity/reads-outlier.png" alt="Reads with an outlier entity"></p>
<p>Hey, the amount of reads almost doubled! The line also doesn&#39;t look linear anymore...</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the <strong>third extreme scenario</strong> when all 1000 events were generated by the <strong>same entity</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/11/event-sourcing-and-io-complexity/reads-single.png" alt="Reads from single entity"></p>
<p>The amount of reads skyrockets to <strong>100 times more</strong> compared to the first scenario. It&#39;s clearly quadratic!
The amount of reads for a single entity is <code>O(l)</code> where <code>l</code> is the event count for that entity.</p>
<h2 id="real-life-scenario">Real-Life Scenario</h2>
<p>In many use cases it&#39;s unlikely that you get outlier entities which have orders of magnitude difference in amount 
of events per entity. E.g. if your entity is an order in a webshop, there&#39;s just a few events that humans can 
generate about it.</p>
<p>However, if the events are generated from telemetry data or IoT devices, or if the entities tend to live for very 
long time (like bank accounts), that&#39;s a good sign you should not ignore the potential problem. A handful of anomaly 
devices can bring the whole storage to its knees, if protection is not carefully designed.</p>
<p>If your domain has a chance to belong to the second group, you better get prepared.</p>
<h2 id="capacity-planning-and-monitoring">Capacity Planning and Monitoring</h2>
<p>It&#39;s not enough to know just the total number of events in your store, nor is the incoming rate of new events
descriptive enough. </p>
<p>Start with modeling your Event Store against real data. Put some monitoring in place to see the distribution of 
event density per entity. Average number is not descriptive enough, so you need to build percentiles and 
know the maximum too.</p>
<p>Monitor the amount of reads on your data store. Set the baseline based on the real data
pattern, not imaginary numbers.</p>
<h2 id="throttling-sampling">Throttling / Sampling</h2>
<p>In IoT scenarios the easiest way out could be to discard events if they arrive too frequently from the same device, 
or use some sampling/aggregation at the ingress point. Only your business domain can define what kind of
data loss is acceptable, if any.</p>
<h2 id="snapshots">Snapshots</h2>
<p>Event Sourcing concept provides the solution for the reads problem in form of Snapshots. Once in every <code>x</code> events, 
you should produce a snapshot of the entity state. The next time an event comes in, you just read
the snapshot and the events which happened after the latest snapshot time (amount is less than <code>x</code>).</p>
<p>It might be tricky to come up with a good snapshot strategy in some cases, especially when the business domain
requires multiple projections to be built. </p>
<p>The snapshot size might also grow over time, if entity keeps some internal event-based lists. But snapshots 
seem to be the only real solution when the amount of events gets out of control. Choose your Event Store 
technology with this consideration in mind.</p>
<p>Happy Event Sourcing!</p>

    <h1><a href='/2016/10/leaflet-plugin-to-render-geographic-corridors'>Leaflet plugin to render geographic corridors</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Yesterday I&#39;ve published a simple <a href="http://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a> plugin called
<a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/leaflet-corridor">leaflet-corridor</a>. 
The plugin defines a new Leaflet primitive <code>L.Corridor</code>.</p>
<p>When initialized with an array of geo points and width, it renders a polyline 
with width fixed in meters, not in pixels. That means that line width changes whenever 
zoom level changes. </p>
<p><img src="/2016/10/leaflet-plugin-to-render-geographic-corridors/leaflet-corridor.gif" alt="Leaflet-corridor animation"></p>
<p>The plugin is handy to denote geographic corridors: ranges of specified width around 
a polyline. In our project we used it to show a predefined vehicle route from Origin to
Destination, with only limited allowed violation from this predefined route. Whenever
vehicle&#39;s position falls out of this corridor, the event of Out-of-corridor violation
is recorded and shown on the map.</p>
<p>Here are all the links for the corridor plugin:</p>
