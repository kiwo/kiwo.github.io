    <h1><a href='/2018/06/programmable-cloud-provisioning-azure-app-service-with-pulumi/'>Programmable Cloud: Provisioning Azure App Service with Pulumi</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Modern Cloud providers offer a wide variety of services of different types
and levels. A modern cloud application would leverage multiple services
in order to be efficient in terms of developer experience, price, operations
etc.</p>
<p>For instance, a very simple Web Application deployed to Azure PaaS services
could use</p>
<ul>
<li>App Service - to host the application</li>
<li>App Service Plan - to define the instance size, price, scaling and other
hosting parameters</li>
<li>Azure SQL Database - to store relational data</li>
<li>Application Insights - to collect telemetry and logs</li>
<li>Storage Account - to store the binaries and leverage Run-as-Zip feature</li>
</ul>
<p>Provisioning such environment becomes a task on its own:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we create the initial setup?</li>
<li>How do we make changes?</li>
<li>What if we need multiple environments?</li>
<li>How do we apply settings?</li>
<li>How do we recycle resources which aren&#39;t needed anymore?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, there are several options.</p>
<h2 id="manually-in-azure-portal">Manually in Azure Portal</h2>
<p>We all start doing this in Azure Portal. User Interface is great for
discovering new services and features, and it&#39;s a quick way to make a single
change.</p>
<p><img src="/2018/06/programmable-cloud-provisioning-azure-app-service-with-pulumi//azureportal.png" alt="Azure Portal"></p>
<p><em>Creating an App Service in Azure Portal</em></p>
<p>Clicking buttons manually doesn&#39;t scale though. After the initial setup is
complete, maintaining the environment over time poses significant challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every change requires going back to the portal, finding the right resource
and doing the right change</li>
<li>People make mistakes, so if you have multiple environments, they are likely
to be different in subtle ways</li>
<li>Naming gets messy over time</li>
<li>There is no easily accessible history of environment changes</li>
<li>Cleaning up is hard: usually some leftovers will remain unnoticed</li>
<li>Skills are required from everybody involved in provisioning</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how do we streamline this process?</p>
<h2 id="azure-powershell-cli-and-management-sdks">Azure PowerShell, CLI and Management SDKs</h2>
<p>Azure comes with a powerful set of tools to manage resources with code.</p>
<p>You can use PowerShell, CLI scripts or custom code like C# to do with code
whatever is possible to do via portal.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs cs"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> webApp = azure.WebApps.Define(appName)
    .WithRegion(Region.WestEurope)
    .WithNewResourceGroup(rgName)
    .WithNewFreeAppServicePlan()
    .Create();
</code></pre>
<p><em>Fluent C# code creating an App Service</em></p>
<p>However, those commands are usually expressed in imperative style of 
CRUD operations. You can run the commands once, but it&#39;s hard to modify
existing resources from an arbitrary state to the desired end state.</p>
<h2 id="azure-resource-manager-templates">Azure Resource Manager Templates</h2>
<p>All services in Azure are managed by Azure Resource Manager (ARM). ARM 
has a special JSON-based format for templates. </p>
<p>Once a template is defined,
it&#39;s relatively straightforward to be deployed to Azure environment. So, if
resources are defined in JSON, they will be created automatically via
PowerShell or CLI commands.</p>
<p>It is also possible to deploy templates in incremental mode, when the tool
will compare existing environment with desired configuration and will deploy
the difference.</p>
<p>Templates can be parametrized, which enables multi-environment deployments.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a problem with templates though: they are JSON files. They get
very large very fast, they are hard to reuse, it&#39;s easy to make a typo.</p>
<p><img src="/2018/06/programmable-cloud-provisioning-azure-app-service-with-pulumi//armtemplate.png" alt="ARM Template"></p>
<p><em>A fragment of auto-generated ARM Template for App Service, note the 
line numbers</em></p>
<p>Terraform is another templating tool to provision cloud resources but it uses
YAML instead of JSON. I don&#39;t have much experience with it, but the problems 
seem to be very similar.</p>
<p>Can we combine the power of SDKs and the power of JSON-/YAML-based desired state
configuration tools?</p>
<h2 id="pulumi">Pulumi</h2>
<p>One potential solution has just arrived.
A startup called Pulumi <a href="http://joeduffyblog.com/2018/06/18/hello-pulumi/">just went out of private beta to open source</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/2018/06/programmable-cloud-provisioning-azure-app-service-with-pulumi//pulumi.jpg" alt="Pulumi"></p>
<p>Pulumi wants to be much more than a better version of ARM templates, aiming
to become the tool to build cloud-first distributed systems. But for today I&#39;ll 
focus on lower level of resource provisioning task.</p>
<p>With Pulumi cloud infrastructure is defined in code using full-blown general 
purpose programming languages.</p>
<p>The workflow goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a Stack, which is a container for a group of related resources</li>
<li>Write a program in one of supported languages (I&#39;ll use TypeScript) which
references <code>pulumi</code> libraries and constructs all the resources as objects</li>
<li>Establish connection with your Azure account</li>
<li>Call <code>pulumi</code> CLI to create, update or destroy Azure resources based on
the program</li>
<li>Pulumi will first show the preview of changes, and then apply them as
requested</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pulumi-program">Pulumi Program</h2>
<p>I&#39;m using TypeScript to define my Azure resources in Pulumi. So, the program
is a normal Node.js application with <code>index.ts</code> file, package references in 
<code>package.json</code> and one extra file <code>Pulumi.yaml</code> to define the program:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs yaml"><span class="hljs-attr">name:</span> <span class="hljs-string">azure-appservice</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">runtime:</span> <span class="hljs-string">nodejs</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Our <code>index.js</code> is as simple as a bunch of <code>import</code> statements followed by
creating TypeScript objects per desired resource. The simplest program can
look like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ts"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> pulumi <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"@pulumi/pulumi"</span>;
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> azure <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"@pulumi/azure"</span>;

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> resourceGroup = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> azure.core.ResourceGroup(<span class="hljs-string">"myrg"</span>, {
    location: <span class="hljs-string">"West Europe"</span>
});
</code></pre>
<p>When executed by <code>pulumi update</code> command, this program will create a new
Resource Group in your Azure subscription.</p>
<h2 id="chaining-resources">Chaining Resources</h2>
<p>When multiple resources are created, the properties of one resource will
depend on properties of the others. E.g. I&#39;ve defined the Resource Group
above, and now I want to create an App Service Plan under this Group:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ts"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> resourceGroupArgs = {
    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,
    location: resourceGroup.location
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> appServicePlan = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> azure.appservice.Plan(<span class="hljs-string">"myplan"</span>, {
    ...resourceGroupArgs,

    kind: <span class="hljs-string">"App"</span>,

    sku: {
        tier: <span class="hljs-string">"Basic"</span>,
        size: <span class="hljs-string">"B1"</span>,
    },
});
</code></pre>
<p>I&#39;ve assigned <code>resourceGroupName</code> and <code>location</code> of App Service Plan to
values from the Resource Group. It looks like a simple assignment of
strings but in fact it&#39;s more complicated.</p>
<p>Property <code>resourceGroup.name</code> has the type of <code>pulumi.Output&lt;string&gt;</code>.
Constructor argument <code>resourceGroupName</code> of <code>Plan</code> has the type of
<code>pulumi.Input&lt;string&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>We assigned <code>&quot;myrg&quot;</code> value to Resource Group name, but during the actual 
deployment it will change. Pulumi will append a unique identifier to the name,
so the actually provisioned group will be named e.g. <code>&quot;myrg65fb103e&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>This value will materialize inside <code>Output</code> type only at deployment time, 
and then it will get propagated to <code>Input</code> by Pulumi.</p>
<p>There is also a nice way to return the end values of <code>Output</code>&#39;s from Pulumi
program. Let&#39;s say we define an App Service:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ts"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> app = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> azure.appservice.AppService(<span class="hljs-string">"mywebsite"</span>, {
    ...resourceGroupArgs,

    appServicePlanId: appServicePlan.id
});
</code></pre>
<p>First, notice how we used TypeScript spread operator to reuse
properties from <code>resourceGroupArgs</code>.</p>
<p>Second, <code>Output</code>-<code>Input</code> assignment got used again to propagate App Service
Plan ID.</p>
<p>Lastly, we can now export App Service host name from our program, e.g.
for the user to be able to go to the web site immediately after deployment:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ts">exports.hostname = app.defaultSiteHostname;
</code></pre>
<p><code>Output</code> can also be transformed with <code>apply</code> function. Here is the code to
format output URL:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ts">exports.endpoint = app.defaultSiteHostname.apply(<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-params">n</span> =&gt;</span> <span class="hljs-string">`https://<span class="hljs-subst">${n}</span>`</span>);
</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>pulumi update</code> from CLI will then print the endpoint for us:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs sh">---outputs:---
endpoint: <span class="hljs-string">"https://mywebsiteb76260b5.azurewebsites.net"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Multiple outputs can be combined with <code>pulumi.all</code>, e.g. given SQL Server
and Database, we could make a connection string:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ts"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> connectionString = 
    pulumi.all([sqlServer, database]).apply(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">[server, db]</span>) =&gt;</span> 
        <span class="hljs-string">`Server=tcp:<span class="hljs-subst">${server}</span>.database.windows.net;initial catalog=<span class="hljs-subst">${db}</span>;user ID=<span class="hljs-subst">${username}</span>;password=<span class="hljs-subst">${pwd}</span>;Min Pool Size=0;Max Pool Size=30;Persist Security Info=true;`</span>)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="using-the-power-of-npm">Using the Power of NPM</h2>
<p>Since our program is just a TypeScript application, we are free to use any
3rd party package which exists out there in NPM.</p>
<p>For instance, we can install Azure Storage SDK. Just</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs sh">npm install azure-storage@2.9.0-preview
</code></pre>
<p>and then we can write a function to produce SAS token for a Blob in Azure
Storage:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ts"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> azurestorage <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">"azure-storage"</span>;

<span class="hljs-comment">// Given an Azure blob, create a SAS URL that can read it.</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> <span class="hljs-title">signedBlobReadUrl</span>(<span class="hljs-params">
    blob: azure.storage.Blob | azure.storage.ZipBlob,
    account: azure.storage.Account,
    container: azure.storage.Container,
</span>): <span class="hljs-title">pulumi</span>.<span class="hljs-title">Output</span>&lt;<span class="hljs-title">string</span>&gt; </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> signatureExpiration = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">Date</span>(<span class="hljs-number">2100</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>);

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> pulumi.all([
        account.primaryConnectionString,
        container.name,
        blob.name,
    ]).apply(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">[connectionString, containerName, blobName]</span>) =&gt;</span> {
        <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> blobService = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> azurestorage.BlobService(connectionString);
        <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> signature = blobService.generateSharedAccessSignature(
            containerName,
            blobName,
            {
                AccessPolicy: {
                    Expiry: signatureExpiration,
                    Permissions: azurestorage.BlobUtilities.SharedAccessPermissions.READ,
                },
            }
        );

        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> blobService.getUrl(containerName, blobName, signature);
    });
}
</code></pre>
<p>I took this function from <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-functions">Azure Functions</a>
example, and it will probably move to Pulumi libraries at some point, but until
then you are free to leverage the package ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="deploying-application-files">Deploying Application Files</h2>
<p>So far we provisioned Azure App Service, but we can also deploy the application
files as part of the same workflow.</p>
<p>The code below is using <a href="https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues/84">Run from Zip</a>
feature of App Service:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Define Storage Account and Container</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ts"> <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> storageAccount = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> azure.storage.Account(<span class="hljs-string">"mystorage"</span>, {
     ...resourceGroupArgs,

     accountKind: <span class="hljs-string">"StorageV2"</span>,
     accountTier: <span class="hljs-string">"Standard"</span>,
     accountReplicationType: <span class="hljs-string">"LRS"</span>,
 });

 <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> storageContainer = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> azure.storage.Container(<span class="hljs-string">"mycontainer"</span>, {
     resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,
     storageAccountName: storageAccount.name,
     containerAccessType: <span class="hljs-string">"private"</span>,
 });
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Create a folder with application files, e.g. <code>wwwroot</code>. It may contain
some test HTML, ASP.NET application, or anything supported by App Service.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Produce a zip file from that folder in Pulumi program:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ts"> <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> blob = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> azure.storage.ZipBlob(<span class="hljs-string">"myzip"</span>, {
     resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,
     storageAccountName: storageAccount.name,
     storageContainerName: storageContainer.name,
     <span class="hljs-keyword">type</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"block"</span>,

     content: <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> pulumi.asset.FileArchive(<span class="hljs-string">"wwwroot"</span>)
 });
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Produce SAS Blob URL and assign it to App Service Run-as-Zip setting:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs ts"> <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> codeBlobUrl = signedBlobReadUrl(blob, storageAccount, storageContainer);

 <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> app = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> azure.appservice.AppService(<span class="hljs-string">"mywebsite"</span>, {
     ...resourceGroupArgs,

     appServicePlanId: appServicePlan.id,

     appSettings: {
         <span class="hljs-string">"WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_ZIP"</span>: codeBlobUrl
     }
 });
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Run the program, and your Application will start as soon as <code>pulumi update</code>
is complete.</p>
<h2 id="determinism">Determinism</h2>
<p>Pulumi programs should strive to be deterministic.
That means you should avoid using things like current date/time or random numbers.</p>
<p>The reason is incremental updates. Every time you run <code>pulumi update</code>, it
will execute the program from scratch. If your resources depend on random
values, they will not match the existing resources and thus the false
delta will be detected and deployed.</p>
<p>In the SAS generation example above we used a fixed date in the future
instead of doing today + 1 year kind of calculation.</p>
<p>Should Pulumi provide some workaround for this?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You can find the complete example of provisioning App Service with
SQL Database and Application Insights in 
<a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/examples/tree/azure-ts-appservice/azure-ts-appservice">my github</a>.</p>
<p>I really see high potential in Cloud-as-Code approach suggested by Pulumi.
Today we just scratched the surface of the possibilities. We were working
with cloud services on raw level: provisioning specific services with
given parameters.</p>
<p>Pulumi&#39;s vision includes providing higher-level components to blur the line
between infrastructure and code, and to enable everybody to create such
components on their own.</p>
<p>Exciting future ahead!</p>

    <h1><a href='/2018/05/azure-functions-cold-starts-beyond-first-load/'>Cold Starts Beyond First Request in Azure Functions</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>In my <a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers/">previous article</a>
I&#39;ve explored the topic of Cold Starts in Azure Functions. Particularly, I&#39;ve measured the
cold start delays per language and runtime version.</p>
<p>I received some follow-up questions that I&#39;d like to explore in today&#39;s post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we avoid cold starts except the very first one by keeping the instance warm?</li>
<li>Given one warm instance, if two requests come at the same time, will one request hit 
a cold start because existing instance is busy with the other?</li>
<li>In general, does a cold start happen at scale-out when a new extra instance is provisioned?</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, we are only talking Consumption Plan here.</p>
<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>
<p>Azure Functions are running on instances provided by Azure App Service. Each instance is
able to process several requests concurrently, which is different comparing to AWS Lambda.</p>
<p>Thus, the following <em>could</em> be true:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we issue at least 1 request every 20 minutes, the first instance should stay warm for
long time</li>
<li>Simultaneous requests don&#39;t cause cold start unless the existing instance gets too busy</li>
<li>When runtime decides to scale out and spin up a new instance, it could do so in the background,
still forwarding incoming requests to the existing warm instance(s). Once the new instance
is ready, it could be added to the pool without causing cold starts</li>
<li>If so, cold starts are mitigated beyond the very first execution</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s put this theory under test!</p>
<h2 id="keeping-always-warm">Keeping Always Warm</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve tested a Function App which consists of two Functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP Function under test</li>
<li>Timer Function which runs every 10 minutes and does nothing but logging 1 line of text</li>
</ul>
<p>I then measured the cold start statistics similar to all the tests from my previous article.</p>
<p>During 2 days I was issuing infrequent requests to the same app, most of them would normally
lead to a cold start. Interestingly, even though I was regularly firing the timer, Azure 
switched instances to serve my application 2 times during the test period:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/05/azure-functions-cold-starts-beyond-first-load//cold-starts-keep-warm.png" alt="Infrequent Requests to Azure Functions with &quot;Keep It Warm&quot; Timer"></p>
<p>I can see that most responses are fast, so timer &quot;warmer&quot; definitely helps.</p>
<p>The first request(s) to a new instance are slower than subsequent ones. Still, they are faster
than normal full cold start time, so it could be related to HTTP stack loading.</p>
<p>Anyway, keeping Functions warm seems a viable strategy.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-requests">Parallel Requests</h2>
<p>What happens when there is a warm instance, but it&#39;s already busy with processing another
request? Will the parallel request be delayed, or will it be processed by the same
warm instance?</p>
<p>I tested with a very lightweight function, which nevertheless takes some time to complete:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs cs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; <span class="hljs-title">Delay500</span>(<span class="hljs-params">[HttpTrigger] HttpRequestMessage req</span>)
</span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> Task.Delay(<span class="hljs-number">500</span>);
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, <span class="hljs-string">"Done"</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>I believe it&#39;s an OK approximation for an IO-bound function.</p>
<p>The test client then issued 2 to 10 parallel requests to this function and measured the
response time for all requests.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not the easiest chart to understand in full, but note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each group of bars are for requests sent at the same time. Then there goes a pause about
20 seconds before the next group of requests gets sent</p>
</li>
<li><p>The bars are colored by the instance which processed that request: same instance - same
color</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/2018/05/azure-functions-cold-starts-beyond-first-load//cold-starts-during-simultaneous-requests.png" alt="Azure Functions Response Time to Batches of Simultaneous Requests"></p>
<p>Here are some observations from this experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Out of 64 requests, there were 11 cold starts</p>
</li>
<li><p>Same instance <em>can</em> process multiple simultaneous requests, e.g. one instance processed
7 out of 10 requests in the last batch</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nonetheless, Azure is eager to spin up new instances for multiple requests. In total
12 instances were created, which is even more than max amount of requests in any single
batch</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some of those instances were actually never reused (gray-ish bars in batched x2 and x3,
brown bar in x10)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The first request to each new instance pays the full cold start price. Runtime doesn&#39;t
provision them in background while reusing existing instances for received requests</p>
</li>
<li><p>If an instance handled more than one request at a time, response time invariably suffers,
even though the function is super lightweight (<code>Task.Delay</code>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Getting back to the experiment goals, there are several things that we learned.</p>
<p>For low-traffic apps with sporadic requests it makes sense to setup a &quot;warmer&quot; timer
function firing every 10 minutes or so to prevent the only instance from being recycled.</p>
<p>However, scale-out cold starts are real and I don&#39;t see any way to prevent them from
happening.</p>
<p>When multiple requests come in at the same time, we might expect some of them to hit
a new instance and get slowed down. The exact algorithm of instance reuse is not
entirely clear.</p>
<p>Same instance is capable of processing multiple requests in parallel, so there are
possibilities for optimization in terms of routing to warm instances during the
provisioning of cold ones. </p>
<p>If such optimizations happen, I&#39;ll be glad to re-run my tests and report any noticeable
improvements.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more serverless perf goodness!</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Auto-provisioning and auto-scalability are the killer features of Function-as-a-Service
cloud offerings, and Azure Functions in particular.</p>
<p>One drawback of such dynamic provisioning is a phenomenon called &quot;Cold Start&quot;. Basically,
applications that haven&#39;t been used for a while take longer to startup and to handle the
first request.</p>
<p>The problem is nicely described in 
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2018/02/07/understanding-serverless-cold-start/">Understanding Serverless Cold Start</a>,
so I won&#39;t repeat it here. I&#39;ll just copy a picture from that article:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstart.jpg" alt="Cold Start"></p>
<p>Based on the 4 actions which happen during a cold start, we may guess that the following factors
might affect the cold start duration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language / execution runtime</li>
<li>Azure Functions runtime version</li>
<li>Application size including dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>I ran several sample functions and tried to analyze the impact of these factors on cold start time.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>All tests were run against HTTP Functions, because that&#39;s where cold start matters the most.</p>
<p>All the functions were just returning &quot;Hello, World&quot; taking the &quot;World&quot; value from the query string.
Some functions were also loading extra dependencies, see below.</p>
<p>I did not rely on execution time reported by Azure. Instead, I measured end-to-end duration from
client perspective. All calls were made from within the same Azure region, so network latency should 
have minimal impact:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//test-setup.png" alt="Test Setup"></p>
<h2 id="when-does-cold-start-happen-">When Does Cold Start Happen?</h2>
<p>Obviously, cold start happens when the very first request comes in. After that request is processed,
the instance is kept alive in case subsequent requests arrive. But for how long?</p>
<p>The following chart gives the answer. It shows values of normalized request durations across
different languages and runtime versions (Y axis) depending on the time since the previous
request in minutes (X axis):</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstart-threshold.png" alt="Cold Start Threshold"></p>
<p>Clearly, an idle instance lives for 20 minutes and then gets recycled. All requests after 20 minutes
threshold hit another cold start.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-languages-compare-">How Do Languages Compare?</h2>
<p>I&#39;ll start with version 1 of Functions runtime, which is the production-ready GA version as of today.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written Hello World HTTP function in all GA languages: C#, F# and Javascript, and I added Python
for comparison. C#/F# were executed both in the form of script, and as a precompiled .NET assembly.</p>
<p>The following chart shows some intuition about the cold start duration per language. The languages
are ordered based on mean response time, from lowest to highest. 65% of request
durations are inside the vertical bar (1-sigma interval) and 95% are inside the vertical line (2-sigma):</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstarts-v1.png" alt="Cold Start V1 per Language"></p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, precompiled .NET is exactly on par with Javascript. Javascript &quot;Hello World&quot; 
is really lightweight, so I expected it to win, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>C# Script is slower but somewhat comparable. F# Script presented a really negative surprise though: it&#39;s much
slower. It&#39;s even slower than experimental Python support where no performance optimization would
be expected at all!</p>
<h2 id="functions-runtime-v1-vs-v2">Functions Runtime: V1 vs V2</h2>
<p>Version 2 of Functions runtime is currently in preview and not suitable for production load. That
probably means they haven&#39;t done too much performance optimization, especially from cold start
standpoint.</p>
<p>Can we see this on the chart? We sure can:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstarts-v2.png" alt="Cold Start V1 vs V2"></p>
<p>V2 is massively slower. The fastest cold starts are around 6 seconds, but the slowest can come
up to 40-50 seconds.</p>
<p>Javascript is again on-par with precompiled .NET. </p>
<p>Java is noticeably slower, even though the
deployment package is just 33kB, so I assume I didn&#39;t overblow it.</p>
<h2 id="does-size-matter-">Does Size Matter?</h2>
<p>OK, enough of Hello World. A real-life function might be more heavy, mainly because it would
depend on other third-party libraries.</p>
<p>To simulate such scenario, I&#39;ve measured cold starts for a .NET function with references to 
Entity Framework, Automapper, Polly and Serilog.</p>
<p>For Javascript I did the same, but referenced Bluebird, lodash and AWS SDK.</p>
<p>Here are the results:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstarts-dependencies.png" alt="Cold Start Dependencies"></p>
<p>As expected, the dependencies slow the loading down. You should keep your Functions lean,
otherwise you will pay in seconds for every cold start.</p>
<p>An important note for Javascript developers: the above numbers are for Functions deployed
after <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-pack"><code>Funcpack</code></a> preprocessor. The package
contained the single <code>js</code> file with Webpack-ed dependency tree. Without that, the mean
cold start time of the same function is 20 seconds!</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Here are some lessons learned from all the experiments above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be prepared for 1-3 seconds cold starts even for the smallest Functions</li>
<li>Stay on V1 of runtime until V2 goes GA unless you don&#39;t care about perf</li>
<li>.NET precompiled and Javascript Functions have roughly same cold start time</li>
<li>Minimize the amount of dependencies, only bring what&#39;s needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see anything weird or unexpected in my results? Do you need me to dig deeper on other aspects?
Please leave a comment below or ping me on twitter, and let&#39;s sort it all out.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I&#39;m writing this post in the train to London Stensted, on my way back from F# Exchange 2018
conference.</p>
<p>F# Exchange is a yearly conference taking place in London, and 2018 edition was the first one
for me personally. I also had an honour to speak there about creating Azure Functions with
F#.</p>
<h2 id="impression">Impression</h2>
<p>F# is still relatively niche language, so the conference is not overcrowded, but that gives
it a special feeling of family gathering. There were 162 participants this year, and I have an
impression that every one of them is extremely friendly, enthusiastic and just plain awesome.</p>
<p>The conference itself had 2 tracks of 45-minute talks and 60-minute keynotes. Most talks were
of high quality, and the topics ranging from compiler internals to fun applications like 
music generation, car racing and map drawing.</p>
<p>Both Don Syme, the creator of F#, and Philip Carter, F# program manager, were there and gave
keynotes, but they were careful enough not to draw too much attention on Microsoft and let
the community speak loud.</p>
<h2 id="corridor-track">Corridor Track</h2>
<p>But the talks were just a part of the story. For me, the conference started in the evening
before the first day at the speakers drinks party, and only finished at 1 a.m. after the 
second day (the pubs in London are lovely).</p>
<p>I spoke to so many great people, I learnt a lot, and had fun too. I&#39;ve never seen so many
F# folks at the same place, and I guess there must be something about F# which attracts
the right kind of people to it.</p>
<p>And of course it&#39;s so much fun to meet face-to-face all those twitter, slack, github and 
Channel 9 persona&#39;s and to see that they are actually real people :)</p>
<h2 id="my-talk">My Talk</h2>
<p>The talk I gave was called &quot;Azure F#unctions&quot;. It was not a hard-core F# talk, but people
seemed to be genuinely interested in the topic.</p>
<p>A decent amount of attendees are already familiar with Azure Functions, and many either run 
them in production or plan to do so.</p>
<p>The reference version conflict problem is very well known and raises a lots of questions
or concerns. This even leads to workarounds like transpiling F# Functions to Javascript
with Fable. Yikes.</p>
<p>Durable Functions seem to be sparkling a lot of initial interest. I&#39;ll be definitely
spending more time to play with them, and maybe to make F# story more smooth.</p>
<p>Functions were mentioned in Philip&#39;s keynote as one of the important areas for F# 
application, which is cool. We should spend some extra effort to make the documentation
and onboarding story as smooth as possible.</p>
<h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2>
<p>Skills Matter is the company behind the conference. Carla, Nicole and others did a great
job preparing the event; everything went smooth, informal and fun.</p>
<p>The videos are already online at <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/9419-f-sharp-exchange-2018#skillscasts">Skillscasts</a> 
(requires free signup).</p>
<p><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/10869-f-sharp-exchange-2019">F# Exchange 2019</a> 
super early bird tickets are for sale now and until Monday April 9, go 
get one and join F# Exchange in London next year! </p>
<p>I&#39;m already missing you all.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2018/02/azure-durable-functions-in-fsharp/'>Azure Durable Functions in F#</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Azure Functions are designed for stateless, fast-to-execute,
simple actions. Typically, they are triggered by an HTTP call or a queue message,
then they read something from the storage or database and return the result
to the caller or send it to another queue. All within several seconds at most.</p>
<p>However, there exists a preview of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-overview">Durable Functions</a>,
an extension that lets you write stateful functions for long-running workflows.
Here is a picture of one possible workflow from the docs:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/02/azure-durable-functions-in-fsharp//fan-out-fan-in.png" alt="Fan-out Fan-in Workflow"></p>
<p>Such workflows might take arbitrary time to complete. Instead of blocking and
waiting for all that period, Durable Functions use the combination of
Storage Queues and Tables to do all the work asynchronously.</p>
<p>The code still <em>feels</em> like one continuous thing because it&#39;s programmed
as a single orchestrator function. So, it&#39;s easier for a human to reason 
about the functionality without the complexities of low-level communication.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t describe Durable Functions any further, just go read
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-overview">documentation</a>,
it&#39;s nice and clean.</p>
<h2 id="language-support">Language Support</h2>
<p>As of February 2018, Durable Functions are still in preview. That also means
that language support is limited:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently C# is the only supported language for Durable Functions. This 
includes orchestrator functions and activity functions. In the future, 
we will add support for all languages that Azure Functions supports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was a bit disappointed that F# is not an option. But actually, since
Durable Functions support precompiled .NET assembly model, pretty much
anything doable in C# can be done in F# too.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to show that you can write Durable Functions in F#.
I used precompiled .NET Standard 2.0 F# Function App running on 2.0 preview
runtime.</p>
<h2 id="orchestration-functions">Orchestration Functions</h2>
<p>The stateful workflows are Azure Functions with a special <code>OrchestrationTrigger</code>.
Since they are asynchronous, C# code is always based on <code>Task</code> and <code>async</code>-<code>await</code>.
Here is a simple example of orchestrator in C#:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs cs"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> Task&lt;List&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">string</span>&gt;&gt; Run([OrchestrationTrigger] DurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> outputs = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> List&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">string</span>&gt;();

    outputs.Add(<span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> context.CallActivityAsync&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">string</span>&gt;(<span class="hljs-string">"E1_SayHello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Tokyo"</span>));
    outputs.Add(<span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> context.CallActivityAsync&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">string</span>&gt;(<span class="hljs-string">"E1_SayHello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Seattle"</span>));
    outputs.Add(<span class="hljs-keyword">await</span> context.CallActivityAsync&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">string</span>&gt;(<span class="hljs-string">"E1_SayHello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"London"</span>));

    <span class="hljs-comment">// returns ["Hello Tokyo!", "Hello Seattle!", "Hello London!"]</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> outputs;
}
</code></pre>
<p>F# has its own preferred way of doing asynchronous code based on <code>async</code>
computation expression. The direct refactoring could look something like</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> Run(<span class="hljs-meta">[&lt;OrchestrationTrigger&gt;]</span> context: DurableOrchestrationContext) = async {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let!</span> hello1 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(<span class="hljs-string">"E1_SayHello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Tokyo"</span>)   |&gt; Async.AwaitTask
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let!</span> hello2 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(<span class="hljs-string">"E1_SayHello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Seattle"</span>) |&gt; Async.AwaitTask
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let!</span> hello3 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(<span class="hljs-string">"E1_SayHello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"London"</span>)  |&gt; Async.AwaitTask
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> [hello1; hello2; hello3]
} |&gt; Async.StartAsTask
</code></pre>
<p>That would work for a normal HTTP trigger, but it blows up for the Orchestrator
trigger because multi-threading operations are not allowed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Orchestrator code must never initiate any async operation except by 
using the DurableOrchestrationContext API. The Durable Task Framework 
executes orchestrator code on a single thread and cannot interact with 
any other threads that could be scheduled by other async APIs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To solve this issue, we need to keep working with <code>Task</code> directly. This is
not very handy with standard F# libraries. So, I pulled an extra NuGet
package <code>TaskBuilder.fs</code> which provides a <code>task</code> computation expression.</p>
<p>The above function now looks very simple:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> Run(<span class="hljs-meta">[&lt;OrchestrationTrigger&gt;]</span> context: DurableOrchestrationContext) = task {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let!</span> hello1 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(<span class="hljs-string">"E1_SayHello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Tokyo"</span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let!</span> hello2 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(<span class="hljs-string">"E1_SayHello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"Seattle"</span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">let!</span> hello3 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(<span class="hljs-string">"E1_SayHello"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"London"</span>)
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> [hello1; hello2; hello3]
}
</code></pre>
<p>And the best part is that it works just fine.</p>
<p><code>SayHello</code> function is Activity trigger based, and no special effort is required
to implement it in F#:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-meta">[&lt;FunctionName("E1_SayHello")&gt;]</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> SayHello(<span class="hljs-meta">[&lt;ActivityTrigger&gt;]</span> name) =
  sprintf <span class="hljs-string">"Hello %s!"</span> name
</code></pre>
<h2 id="more-examples">More Examples</h2>
<p>Durable Functions repository comes with 
<a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/tree/master/samples/precompiled">a set of 4 samples</a>
implemented in C#. I took all of those samples and ported them over to F#.</p>
<p>You&#39;ve already seen the first <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/azure-functions-fsharp-examples/blob/master/12-durable/HelloSequence.fs"><code>Hello Sequence</code> sample</a>
above: the orchestrator calls the activity function 3 times and combines the
results. As simple as it looks, the function will actually run 3 times for each
execution, saving state before each subsequent call.</p>
<p>The second <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/azure-functions-fsharp-examples/blob/master/12-durable/BackupSiteContent.fs"><code>Backup Site Content</code> sample</a>
is using this persistence mechanism to run
a potentially slow workflow of copying all files from a given directory to
a backup location. It shows how multiple activities can be executed in
parallel:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> tasks = Array.map (<span class="hljs-keyword">fun</span> f -&gt; backupContext.CallActivityAsync&lt;int64&gt;(<span class="hljs-string">"E2_CopyFileToBlob"</span>, f)) files
<span class="hljs-keyword">let!</span> results = Task.WhenAll tasks
</code></pre>
<p>The third <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/azure-functions-fsharp-examples/blob/master/12-durable/Counter.fs"><code>Counter</code> example</a>
demos a potentially infinite actor-like workflow, where state can exist and
evolve for indefinite period of time. The key API calls are based on
<code>OrchestrationContext</code>:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs fs"><span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> counterState = counterContext.GetInput&lt;int&gt;()
<span class="hljs-keyword">let!</span> command = counterContext.WaitForExternalEvent&lt;string&gt;(<span class="hljs-string">"operation"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>The final elaborate <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/azure-functions-fsharp-examples/blob/master/12-durable/PhoneVerification.fs"><code>Phone Verification</code> workflow</a>
has several twists, like output binding for activity (<code>ICollector</code> is required
instead of C#&#39;s <code>out</code> parameter), third-party integration (Twilio to send SMSs),
recursive sub-function to loop through several attempts and context-based
timers for reliable timeout implementation.</p>
<p>So, if you happen to be an F# fan, you can still give Durable Functions a try.
Be sure to leave your feedback, so that the library could get even better 
before going GA.</p>
