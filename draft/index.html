<p>Writing code is much easier than reading it.
It gives more gratification.
That&#39;s what we actively learn to do.
That&#39;s what people teach you.
That&#39;s when you feel you are the developer, creator.</p>
<p>You know why? Because writing code is easy.</p>
<p>But guess what? That&#39;s not the ultimate thing you will 
be doing on your day to day job.</p>
<p>You will be reading the code. Trying to understand what
it does. What&#39;s worse: your write code in small portions.
Line by line. But reading doesn&#39;t work this way. You
need to see how pieces come together. Try to see the forest 
behind trees. Jump back and forth between classes, 
modules, functions, APIs.</p>
<p>And it will not make sense. Why is that thing here?
You will blame the writer, but is it really the writer&#39;s
fault or are you not capable to read it? To put yourself
into the cotext of when this code was created. You
have a problem at hand that you need to solve, but all
those other pieces get on your way.</p>
<p>And hey, it&#39;s not even properly formatted. Not as you
want it to be.</p>
<p>And at some point one thing happens. We will rewrite this
code from scratch! It will finally be great. No hacks.
No workaround. Nice architecture. Clean design priciples.
Buzz words of the day. And that&#39;s when you loose. You
lost all the effort spent on writing that old code.
Because you could not read it properly.</p>
<p>But the decision is made. The code gets rewritten. It takes
3 times longer than anticipated. Some corner cases that
you never knew existed are still not working properly.
But the code is nice. It makes sense. </p>
<p>Of course it does. You wrote it just a moment ago. It&#39;s still
in your head, so you don&#39;t need to read it. And you don&#39;t 
feel that pain anymore.</p>
<p>But the years pass. Code base grows. The application is used
in ways which were not anticipated before. Some people leave
the team, so people come. You don&#39;t touch some parts of the
application that often. The context changes. And that feeling
of &quot;knowing everything by hard&quot; slips away. People need to
read the code again. And that&#39;s hard. The legacy revenges.</p>
<p>So, what now? Rewrite again?</p>
<p>Or teach yourself some new skills? Deliberately read other 
people&#39;s code. Open source projects are great in that matters.
It&#39;s all someone else&#39;s code. You don&#39;t know a bit of it. And,
if you want to contribute, you need to adhere to the existing
design, coding standards. You have to undertand why the pieces
are there. You have to read.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t blame. Empaphize.</p>
<p>And when you advance in reading code, your writing changes too.
You leave the hints to others and your future self. You spend
more time refactoring. You are more reluctant to technical
debt. But that&#39;s not a panacea.</p>
<p>Code will drag you down. The more code you have, the harder 
it is to read. Code is not an asset, it&#39;s a liability.</p>
<p>So, the next skill you need is deleting code. You read the code
and you know a block is not used anymore. Delete it. Even it&#39;s
2 lines. This will save time in the future. Build the test suite
around the code make deletes easier.</p>
<p>Did you delete more lines of code that you wrote today? Well 
done if so.</p>
<p>And then comes the ultimate goal for the rest of your developer
lifetime. Prevent code from being written. Question the value of
the code to be written. Seek for abstractions to enable reusability.
Foster the culture of value creation, not code writing. That&#39;s not
the only way.</p>
<p>And for today, go read someone else&#39;s code. It should be hard.
That&#39;s normal for learning.</p>
