                        <p>The very first cold start happens when the very first request comes in after deployment.</p>

<p>After that request is processed, the instance stays alive for the time being to be reused for subsequent requests. But for how long?</p>

<p>The following chart attempts to answer this question. It plots the response duration in seconds (Y-axis) by the interval since the previous requests (X-axis). Each point represents a single request in the data set. Blue points are cold starts and red points are responses from warm instances:</p>

<p>Google tends to keep an instance for long time: most instances survive 5 hours of inactivity.</p>

<p>The points of cold starts look pretty random. Most probably, Google makes the decision based on the current demand/supply ratio in the given resource pool.</p>

<p>The following chart estimates the probability of a cold start (Y-axis) by the interval between two subsequent requests (X-axis):</p>





<script type="text/javascript">

<p>Based on this chart, <strong>85% of instances survive 5 hours of inactivity</strong>.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t assume the probabilities on this chart to be precise, but the overall trend should be representative.</p>
