    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Let&#39;s talk about T-SQL today.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need to produce a result set, which would contain N rows with numbers 1...N in each row. For example, I needed to calculate some statistics per week for N weeks starting from today and going back to the past.</p>
<p>Here is a table funtion which does the enumeration:</p>
<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION dbo.fnEnumerateNumbers(@max int) 
RETURNS TABLE 
RETURN 
WITH
 E1(N) AS (SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL
           SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL
           SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL SELECT 1 UNION ALL
           SELECT 1),                 --10E1  or 10 rows
 E2(N) AS (SELECT 1 FROM E1 a, E1 b), --10E2  or 100 rows
 E4(N) AS (SELECT 1 FROM E2 a, E2 b), --10E4  or 10000 rows
 E8(N) AS (SELECT 1 FROM E4 a, E4 b)  --10E8  or 100000000 rows
SELECT TOP (@max) N = ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) 
  FROM E8</code></pre><p>Usage is trivial:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT N
  FROM dbo.fnEnumerateNumbers(100)</code></pre><p>And here is how I solved the task of enumerating weeks:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT dateadd(week, 1 - N, getutcdate()) 
  FROM dbo.fnEnumerateNumbers(100)</code></pre><p>There are multiple possibilities to implement similar function, but I believe this way is the best one in terms of performance. No temporary tables, no table reads, no dependencies on table existance, and you can define your maximum yourself.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>

    <h1><a href='/2014/05/21/sgen-to-precompile-classes-for-xmpserializer/'>Sgen to precompile classes for XmlSerializer</a></h1>
    

    

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>During my investigation of our ASP.NET application performance issue, I&#39;ve found out that XmlSerializer may require a long warm-up. The first time, when it&#39;s used for a specific class (de-)serialization, can take up to 500 ms om my machine! We use XmlSerializer to encode/decode user preferences. Having 40 different classes being deserialized at user login lead to a massive delay of 14 seconds. This is only for the first user login after the application start-up, but you do quite a lot of &#39;first times&#39; every day while developing the application.</p>
<p>These delays are caused by the runtime which prepares and compiles the strongly typed classes for serialization in runtime. Not sure why it&#39;s SO slow, but probably things might go wrong.</p>
<p>There is a simple solution for this problem: create those helper classes at build time, pack it into an assembly and ship it as part of your .NET application. The tool that does this is called Sgen.exe, and it is a part of .NET SDK. So, we just need to use it in our project.</p>
<p>The easiest way is to add a post-build event in your CS project properties. The event would look like</p>
<pre>sgen.exe /force /assembly:"$(TargetPath)"</pre>
<p>After re-compiling the project, you should see a new assembly in Bin directory, which has the name ending with XmlSerializers.dll. That&#39;s the new assembly which will save you several seconds on each application start-up. It will be automatically copied to Bin directory of the projects which reference the original assembly with your serializable classes, so no other actions needed.</p>
<p>However, this command might fail. Sgen tool will try to prepare the helper classes for each class in your assembly, which might not be possible. Then you&#39;ll get some error messages in Visual Studio. In this case, you might want to add a &quot;/types&quot; parameter, explicitly listing the class names to precompile. But I have a better solution for you.</p>
<p>It&#39;s quite possible that you use MSBuild for regular automated builds of your project. We do. In this case a post-build event in the project properties won&#39;t work during those build. Then, do not add any post-build events, but instead open your .csproj file in plain text editor, and search for the following commented section:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- To modify your build process, add your task inside one of the targets below and uncomment it. 
   Other similar extension points exist, see Microsoft.Common.targets.
&lt;Target Name=&quot;BeforeBuild&quot;&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;
&lt;Target Name=&quot;AfterBuild&quot;&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;
--&gt;</code></pre><p>Uncomment the second XML node and substitute it with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Target Name=&quot;AfterBuild&quot; DependsOnTargets=&quot;AssignTargetPaths;Compile;ResolveKeySource&quot; Inputs=&quot;$(MSBuildAllProjects);@(IntermediateAssembly)&quot; Outputs=&quot;$(OutputPath)$(_SGenDllName)&quot;&gt;
    &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
      &lt;SgenTypes Include=&quot;MyNamespace.MySerializableClass1&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;SgenTypes Include=&quot;MyNamespace.MySerializableClass2&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;SgenTypes Include=&quot;MyNamespace.MySerializableClassN&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;Delete Files=&quot;$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).XmlSerializers.dll&quot; ContinueOnError=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;SGen BuildAssemblyName=&quot;$(TargetFileName)&quot; BuildAssemblyPath=&quot;$(OutputPath)&quot; References=&quot;@(ReferencePath)&quot; ShouldGenerateSerializer=&quot;true&quot; UseProxyTypes=&quot;false&quot; KeyContainer=&quot;$(KeyContainerName)&quot; KeyFile=&quot;$(KeyOriginatorFile)&quot; DelaySign=&quot;$(DelaySign)&quot; ToolPath=&quot;$(SGenToolPath)&quot; Types=&quot;@(SgenTypes)&quot;&gt;
      &lt;Output TaskParameter=&quot;SerializationAssembly&quot; ItemName=&quot;SerializationAssembly&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;/SGen&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;</code></pre><p>The ItemGroup lists all the classes that you need to precompile. You can omit this section and Types attribute of SGen node if you want to compile all classes in assembly.
Have a nice application start-up boost!</p>

        <p>Windows 8 / Windows RT / Windows Store all arrived in October 2012.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve decided to take a shot on writing a commercial application for this new platform. And that&#39;s how Poker Money app appeared.</p>
<p>Here are the links to it:</p>

<p>Poker Money is a basic tool for tracking online poker results, which supports all game types for the two major poker rooms: PokerStars and FullTiltPoker.</p>
<p>Here is a sample screen:

    <h1><a href='/2012/12/26/one-certificate-missing-one-received-unexpectedly/'>One certificate missing, one received unexpectedly</a></h1>
    

    

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Today I want to give a note about two more online courses that I completed.</p>
<p>The last one (10 weeks in September-November) was called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compfinance">Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics</a> and was lead by Eric Zivot from University of Washington. First of all, it was the most intense course out of all that I took to date. Every of 10 weeks we had about 3-4 hours of videos + homework. The course material was mostly about maths and statistics, and less about application in economics. However, some concepts were new to me and sounded very interesting.</p>
<p>I scored about 95% on all tests and exams (they were relatively easy comparing to video material). But unfortunately, I got no certificate or even course record for this! It seems that University of Washington did not allow Coursera to issue such certificates and records... What a shame! I spent lots of time on it, and a record would be satisfactory. Please be careful if you take this course or other courses of UoW in the future.</p>
<p>However, I got another unexpected certificate. In June, I took a course called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/hci">Human-Computer Interaction</a> about user interface design concepts and approaches. I started it with a big delay because of my vacation, so I thought I wouldn&#39;t score enough for a certificate. But I was wrong! I got the certificate 6 months after the course ended:
<img src="/2012/12/26/one-certificate-missing-one-received-unexpectedly//hci.jpg" alt="HCI certificate"></p>
<p>The course was short but useful. I wish there would be an extension course, which would cover more details on the topic.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I&#39;ve recently received a statement of accomplishment document for <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" title="Coursera">Coursera</a>&#39;s online <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/introfinance" title="Introduction to Finance class">Introduction to Finance class</a> that I took in July-September this year.</p>
<p><img src="/2012/11/01/finance-class-at-coursera//finance.jpg" alt="Finance"></p>
<p>The course was lead by prof. Gautam Kaul from University of Michigan. The level of lectures was really introductory, the pace was very slow (too slow for me, even watching x1.5 speed). You could learn about basic finance principles like time value of money, calculating cash flows and discounted values, about stocks and bonds, and risk/return relations.</p>
<p>I liked a lot the assignment tests, which were much stronger and solid then the examples in lectures. They were challenging most of the time, so I&#39;m glad I managed to get 100% score in the end :)</p>
<p>Recommended for anyone who has no idea about what finance is about, but not for experienced students.</p>
