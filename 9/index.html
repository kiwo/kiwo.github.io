    <h1><a href='/2016/05/tweaking-immutable-objects-with-csharp-and-fody/'>Tweaking immutable objects with C# and Fody</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Immutable data structures provide a lot of benefits
to programmers, especially when representing domain 
<a href="https://lostechies.com/joeocampo/2007/04/23/a-discussion-on-domain-driven-design-value-objects/">value objects</a>. 
Immutability is an essential part of functional programming paradigm.
The concept is useful in object-oriented languages too, but you have
to pay some price to get this advantage.</p>
<p>In C# immutable classes are usually implemented with read-only
properties which are populated from constructor parameters. One of the 
disadvantages of this approach is the verbosity of creating a copy of an object
with one property value modified.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s have a look at an illustration of this problem. Let&#39;s say we have a value
type representing poker player statistics:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class PlayerStats
{
    public PlayerStats(
        int hands, 
        int daysOnline,
        Money won, 
        Money expectedValue)
    {
        this.Hands = hands;
        this.DaysOnline = daysOnline;
        this.Won = won;
        this.ExpectedValue = expectedValue;
    }

    public int Hands { get; }
    public int DaysOnline { get; }
    public Money Won { get; }
    public Money ExpectedValue { get; }
}</code></pre>
<p>We already see that it&#39;s quite verbose: basically we repeat each property name
five times. But the issue I&#39;m discussing today is related to how we create 
a new object based on another object. Let&#39;s say we need to make a copy of 
a given statistics, but with <code>Hands</code> property increased by 1:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var increasedHands = new PlayerStats(
    existing.Hands + 1,
    existing.DaysOnline,
    existing.Won,
    existing.ExpectedValue);</code></pre>
<p>Not as simple as we could hope. Also, there is some room for mistakes here. For 
instance, we could swap <code>Won</code> and <code>ExpectedValue</code> property calls
and compiler won&#39;t let us know because the types are the same. So we probably
want to use explicit constructor parameter names:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var increasedHands = new PlayerStats(
    hands: existing.Hands + 1,
    daysOnline: existing.DaysOnline,
    won: existing.Won,
    expectedValue: existing.ExpectedValue);</code></pre>
<p>But that leads to even more typing and repetition...</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>F# is a functional-first language with immutability as first-class concept.
In F# value objects are usually modelled with Records, here is our example
reimplemented:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type PlayerStats = {
    Hands: int
    DaysOnline: int
    Won: Money
    ExpectedValue: Money
}</code></pre>
<p>Creation of new objects based on other objects is also solved properly in F#,
thanks to the <strong><code>with</code></strong> keyword :</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let increasedHands = { existing with Hands = existing.Hands + 1 }</code></pre>
<p>All the properties are copied from the source record except for the ones
explicitly mentioned in the expression.</p>
<h2 id="defining-with-in-c-">Defining With in C#</h2>
<p>There&#39;s no <strong><code>with</code></strong> operator in C#, but we can try to come up with an
alternative. We can define some fluent methods which would change
property values one by one (they don&#39;t change the original object, but
return a copy with changed value):</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public PlayerStats WithHands(int hands) 
{
    return new PlayerStats(
        hands: hands,
        daysOnline: existing.DaysOnline,
        won: existing.Won,
        expectedValue: existing.ExpectedValue);
}

public PlayerStats WithDaysOnline(int daysOnline) { ... }
public PlayerStats WithWon(Money won) { ... }
public PlayerStats WithExpectedValue (Money expectedValue) { ... }</code></pre>
<p>The method implementation is very tedious but the usage gets much cleaner:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var increasedHands = existing.WithHands(existing.Hands + 1);</code></pre>
<p>One way to avoid repetitive code is to generate it.</p>
<h2 id="with-fody-plugin">With.Fody Plugin</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://mikhail.io/2015/12/weaving-your-domain-classes-with-fody/">one of my previous posts</a>
I described how C# value objects can be made less painful with 
<a href="https://github.com/Fody/Fody">Fody</a> - a tool which changes your assembly at
compilation time to provide some desired properties in automated and reliable
fashion.</p>
<p>Please welcome the new Fody plugin <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/With.Fody"><strong>With.Fody</strong></a> 
which auto-implements <code>With</code> method bodies for C# immutable classes.</p>
<p>Here is how to use this plugin for our imaginary example.</p>
<p>First, add a reference to NuGet pakages <code>Fody</code> and <code>With.Fody</code>.</p>
<p>Then, keep the <code>PlayerStats</code> class definition, but get rid of the bodies
of <code>WithXyz</code> methods. Keep the signature but return something trivial like
<code>null</code> or <code>this</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public PlayerStats WithHands(int hands) =&gt; this;
public PlayerStats WithDaysOnline(int daysOnline) =&gt; this;
public PlayerStats WithWon(Money won) =&gt; this;
public PlayerStats WithExpectedValue (Money expectedValue) =&gt; this;</code></pre>
<p>Compile the project and you will see the following line in Build Output:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;      Fody/With:   Added method &#39;With&#39; to type &#39;PlayerStats&#39;.</code></pre><p>It means that the method bodies were re-implemented with calls to 
class constructor with proper parameter values.</p>
<p>The method stubs are needed to satisfy code completion tools like 
IntelliSense and Resharper, otherwise we could skip them altogether.</p>
<h2 id="single-with-for-multiple-properties">Single With() for Multiple Properties</h2>
<p>In case you avoid <a href="https://mikhail.io/2015/08/units-of-measurement-in-domain-design/">Primitive Obsession</a>
antipattern, you will often end up with classes which have unique types of 
properties, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class TripProfile
{
    public TripProfile(
        Distance totalDistance,
        Speed averageSpeed,
        Volume fuelConsumed)
    {
        this.TotalDistance = totalDistance;
        this.AverageSpeed = averageSpeed;
        this.FuelConsumed = fuelConsumed;
    }

    public Distance TotalDistance { get; }
    public Speed AverageSpeed { get; }
    public Volume FuelConsumed { get; }
}</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the plugin can be smart enough to figure out which property
you want to modify just by looking at the type of the argument. The single stub
method can look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public TripProfile With&lt;T&gt;(T value) =&gt; this;</code></pre>
<p>This would get compiled into 3 strongly typed <code>With</code> methods with <code>Distance</code>,
<code>Speed</code> and <code>Volume</code> arguments respectively. Resharper is still happy. And
if you make a mistake and try to call the generic <code>With</code> method with an
argument of wrong type (say <code>int</code>), the compiler will give you an error.</p>
<p>It is safe to call <code>With</code> methods in the same assembly where the class is defined:
the calls get adapted to the real implementation automatically.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-started-with-your-classes">How to Get Started with Your Classes</h2>
<p>Here are the requirements for the classes to be picked up by <strong><code>Fody.With</code></strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a single constructor.</li>
<li>The constructor should have more than one argument.</li>
<li>For each constructor agrument, there must be a gettable property with
same name (case insensitive).</li>
<li>At least one <code>With</code> stub must be defined as described above.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can check out more examples, look at the source code or raise an issue in
<a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/With.Fody">With.Fody github repository</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2016/04/t-sql-merge-statement-is-underrated/'>T-SQL MERGE statement is underrated</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>How many times did you write a SQL to <strong>save</strong> a row without knowing whether the same
primary key already exists or not? You just get an object in your data access layer and
you want to save all fields into the database. </p>
<p>But there is no SAVE statement in SQL, so effectively you need to come up with your 
implementation of &quot;INSERT or UPDATE&quot; command.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s take a concrete example. You have a person object with just 3 fields, here is the
type definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class Person
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
}</code></pre>
<p>Persons are entities, so we chose a GUID for the primary key column. We always generate
the unique identifier at client side and just want to save the <code>Person</code>.</p>
<h2 id="typical-solutions">Typical Solutions</h2>
<p>The typical T-SQL developer&#39;s toolbox contains <code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>,
<code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code> statements. <code>DELETE</code> is of no use here, but the combination of the other
three can be employed to complete the task. The most straightforward option is</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM Person WHERE Id = @Id)
  INSERT Person (Id, Name, Email) VALUES (@Id, @Name, @Email)
ELSE
  UPDATE Person SET Name = @Name AND Email = @Email WHERE Id = @Id</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s 4 lines of code instead of one, but it works. Being more fancy, we can reduce the code to
3 lines of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">UPDATE Person SET Name = @Name AND Email = @Email WHERE Id = @Id
IF @@ROWCOUNT = 0 THEN
  INSERT Person (Id, Name, Email) VALUES (@Id, @Name, @Email)</code></pre>
<p>It should also perform faster if you update more often then insert.</p>
<p>Solved? Not completely...</p>
<p>The problem is that sometimes it doesn&#39;t
work. By default, <code>SELECT</code> doesn&#39;t lock the table, so in race condition scenario there
may be another thread which would insert another row with same Id between the execution of
two statements (or delete the existing row for that matter). Ouch.</p>
<p>If you think that&#39;s just a theoretical problem... Well, it might be for our tiny shiny <code>Person</code>
table, but it will happen for the tables of decent sizes with complex update patterns.</p>
<h2 id="transactions">Transactions</h2>
<p>What do we do when the execution of two statements can cause race conditions with
unpredictable results? We use transactions! So, start a transaction before the statement,
then lock the table in <code>SELECT</code> and commit after all is done. It works, but quite some downsides
again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of boilerplate code</li>
<li>Easy to make a mistake (Which lock do we need? <code>updlock</code>? <code>holdlock</code>? <code>tablockx</code>?)</li>
<li>You might get into a deadlock, so need to handle it gracefully</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="merge">MERGE</h2>
<p>Starting with SQL Server 2008, Microsoft introduced the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/bb510625.aspx">MERGE</a>
statement. Generally, it&#39;s quite powerful and can be used to save all the different rows of a source
table into a target table. But we can also use it for our simple task of saving a person.</p>
<p><code>MERGE</code> is just one statement, so it&#39;s atomic and consistent. It performs very well. 
But the syntax is... oh my god, it&#39;s horrible. Your eyes might bleed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">MERGE Person AS target
USING (SELECT @Id, @Name, @Email) AS source (Id, Name, Email)
   ON (target.Id = source.Id)
 WHEN MATCHED THEN 
      UPDATE SET Name = source.Name, Email = source.Email
 WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
      INSERT (Id, Name, Email) VALUES (source.Id, source.Name, source.Email)</code></pre>
<p>Yes, we repeat the name of each column 6 times. And we say <code>source</code> 7 times. And you can imagine
how the <code>MERGE</code> of a table with 50 columns would look like. And how painful it is to add a new column
to an existing statement written 2 years ago.</p>
<p>By the way, the deadlocks are still possible with <code>MERGE</code> statement, so you need to handle them
properly.</p>
<p>So the developers, even the ones who know about the <code>MERGE</code>, usually choose to use the good old <code>CRUD</code>
combination. But when isn&#39;t the syntax a problem?</p>
<h2 id="generate-it-">Generate It!</h2>
<p>More and more developers shift from writing the stored procedures to using ORMs. With full-blown
ORMs you don&#39;t need to care about particular SQL statements, but you get a bunch of other problems
related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch">Object-relational impedance mismatch</a>.</p>
<p>One possible approach is to use a mini-ORM, for instance <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net">Dapper</a>. 
You do your work in your favourite 
general-purpose language, but stay &quot;close to the metal&quot;, or rather to SQL engine statements.</p>
<p>Here is how I invoke a <code>MERGE</code> statement for a Person object (given a connection from the pool):</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var person = new Person(...);
DapperAdapter.Merge(connection, person);</code></pre>
<p>Voila! The implementation of generic <code>Merge</code> method takes care of the syntax complications.
Write once, use everywhere:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public void Merge&lt;TEntity&gt;(IDbConnection dbConnection, TEntity entity) where TEntity : class
{
    var props = entity.GetType().GetProperties().Select(p =&gt; p.Name).ToList();
    var names = string.Join(&quot;, &quot;, props);
    var values = string.Join(&quot;, &quot;, props.Select(n =&gt; &quot;@&quot; + n));
    var updates = string.Join(&quot;, &quot;, props.Select(n =&gt; $&quot;{n} = @{n}&quot;));
    dbConnection.Execute(
        $@&quot;MERGE {entity.GetType().Name} as target
          USING (VALUES({values}))
          AS SOURCE ({names})
          ON target.Id = @Id
          WHEN matched THEN
            UPDATE SET {updates}
          WHEN not matched THEN
            INSERT({names}) VALUES({values});&quot;,
        entity);
}</code></pre>
<p>Of course, it will only work if you use the convention of naming the <code>Person</code> properties
after the database table. In most cases, there will be a domain class <code>Person</code> and a property
bag class <code>PersonRow</code>, so you&#39;ll have to do the mapping between them. But that might be
easier than writing T-SQL code.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Don&#39;t let the bulky syntax scare you away from the <code>MERGE</code> T-SQL statement. Extend your 
toolbox, and use the tools wisely.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p><em>This is the fourth part of <strong>Building a Poker Bot</strong> series where I describe my experience developing bot software 
to play in online poker rooms. I&#39;m building the bot with .NET framework and F# language which makes the task relatively 
easy and very enjoyable. Here are the previous parts:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-card-recognition/"><em>Building a Poker Bot: Card Recognition</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-string-recognition/"><em>Building a Poker Bot: String and Number Recognition</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/building-a-poker-bot-mouse-movements/"><em>Building a Poker Bot: Mouse Movements</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>This post lays out the most exciting part of the bot. I&#39;ll compose the recognition, flow, decision and mouse clicking
parts together into the bot application. The application is a console executable interacting with multiple 
windows of poker room software.</p>
<h2 id="flow">Flow</h2>
<p>The following picture shows the outline of the application data flow:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/04/building-a-poker-bot-with-akka-net-actors//pokeractors.png" alt="Actor Diagram"></p>
<p><strong>Find Tables</strong> - Every half a second or so we scan all the windows and search for open poker tables among them.
For each poker table we make a screenshot and send those to recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Recognize Screen</strong> - Parse the data from the screenshot. Check whether it&#39;s our turn to make a play now, what
the <a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-card-recognition/">hole cards</a> and 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-string-recognition/">stacks</a> are, produce the detailed
screen information and send it to decision maker.</p>
<p><strong>Make Decision</strong> - Understand if that&#39;s a new hand or there was a past history before. See
what the villains did and which new cards we got. Here the secret sauce comes to play and produces 
a move to be made. Send the action to the mouse clicker.</p>
<p><strong>Click Buttons</strong> - Based on the decision made, click the right buttons. It should be done with proper delays
and <a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/building-a-poker-bot-mouse-movements/">human-like movements</a> so that the villain
and poker room don&#39;t understand that it&#39;s bot who is playing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="let-the-actors-play">Let the Actors Play</h2>
<p>Because of the multi-tabling, the application is intrinsically multi-threaded. At the same time,
the different parts of the flow are executed at different cadence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding tables is triggered by time and is single-threaded</li>
<li>Screen recognition, history detection and decision making run in sequence and can be executed in parallel
for multiple tables</li>
<li>Clicking the buttons is again single-threaded, as it must synchronize the outputs from the previous steps,
put them in sequence with appropriate delays</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the other treats of the flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is reactive and event based</li>
<li>The flow is unidirectional, the output of one step goes to the input of the next step</li>
<li>Most steps are stateless, but the history state needs to be preserved and, ideally, isolated from the other
steps</li>
</ul>
<p>This list of features made me pick the Actor-based <a href="http://getakka.net">Akka.NET</a> framework to implement the flow.</p>
<p>For sure, the application could be done with a bunch of procedural code instead. 
But I found actors to be a useful modeling technique to be employed. 
It goes well with reactive nature of the application and builds the nice 
foundation for more complicated scenarios in the future.</p>
<p>Also, I was curious how F# and Akka.NET would work together.</p>
<h2 id="supervision-hierachy">Supervision Hierachy</h2>
<p>In Akka.NET each actor has a supervisor actor who is managing its lifecycle. All actors together form a
supervision tree. Here is the tree shown for the Player application:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/04/building-a-poker-bot-with-akka-net-actors//actorhierachy.png" alt="Actor Hierachy"></p>
<p>There is just one copy of both Table Finder and Button Clicker actors and they are supervised by the root
User actor. </p>
<p>For each poker table a Recognizer actor gets created. These actors are managed by Table 
Finder. </p>
<p>Each Recognizer actor creates an instance of Decision actor who keeps the hand history
and makes decisions. </p>
<p>Finally, all decisions are sent to one centralized Button Clicker actor whose job is 
to click all the tables with proper delays and in order.</p>

which are described in <a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/">my previous post</a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that each actor is defined in functional style with these
building blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type of incoming and, if needed, outgoing messages</li>
<li>A domain function with business logic</li>
<li>Actor function which puts those parts together</li>
<li>Expression to spawn an actor based on actor function</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the examples to understand this structure better.</p>
<h2 id="table-finder">Table Finder</h2>
<p>Table Finder does not have any meaningful input message. It gets a message from
Akka.NET scheduling system just to be periodically activated.</p>
<p>The domain function is called <code>findWindows</code> and has the type <code>unit -&gt; WindowInfo seq</code>.
It returns the poker window screenshots and titles.</p>
<p>Actor function of type <code>int -&gt; seq&lt;string * WindowInfo&gt;</code> is used by the 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/#RouterSupervisor">Router-Supervisor</a> pattern to 
define the behavior. The ouput tuple defines an ID of an output actor and a
message to send to it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let findActor msg = 
  findWindows ()
  |&gt; Seq.map (fun x -&gt; (&quot;recognizer-actor-&quot; + x.TableName, x))</code></pre>
<p>Here is how I spawn the singleton instance of this actor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let tableFinderRef = 
  actorOfRouteToChildren findActor (spawnChild recognizer)
  |&gt; spawn system &quot;table-finder-actor&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>spawnChild</code> is a helper function - essentially an adapter of standard
<code>spawn</code> function with proper parameter order:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let spawnChild childActor name (mailbox : Actor&lt;&#39;a&gt;) = 
  spawn mailbox.Context name childActor</code></pre>
<p>We can also extend it to debug messages when new actors get created.</p>
<h2 id="recognizer">Recognizer</h2>
<p>Recognizer receives the <code>WindowInfo</code> produced by the Table Finder.</p>
<p>The domain function has the type of <code>Bitmap -&gt; Screen</code>. You can read more about table
recognition in <a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-card-recognition/">Part 1</a> and
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-string-recognition/">Part 2</a>
of these series.</p>
<p>Actor function is an implementation of 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/#ConverterSupervisor">Converter-Supervisor</a> pattern. 
The output is a decision message for Decision Maker actor which is a supervised 
child of the Recognizer. Here is the actor function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let recognizeActor (window : WindowInfo) =
  let result = recognize window.Bitmap
  { WindowTitle = window.Title 
    TableName = window.TableName 
    Screen = result 
    Bitmap = window.Bitmap }</code></pre>
<p>And here is the spawn function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let recognizer = actorOfConvertToChild recognizeActor (spawnChild decider &quot;decider&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Notice how this expression was used in Table Finder instantiation above.</p>
<h2 id="decision-maker">Decision Maker</h2>
<p>Decision Maker actor function is an implementation of 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/#StatefulConverter">Stateful Converter</a> pattern. It receives
a decision message from a Recognizer. The output is a click message for a 
singleton Clicker actor. It also needs to preserve some state between two calls.
In the minimalistic implementation this state holds the previous screen that
it received, so that if the same message is received twice, the later message is 
ignored.</p>
<p>This way the actor function has the type of 
<code>DecisionMessage -&gt; Screen option -&gt; ClickerMessage * Screen option</code> 
and looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let decisionActor msg lastScreen =
  let screen = msg.Screen
  match lastScreen with
  | Some s when s = screen -&gt; (None, lastScreen)
  | _ -&gt;
    let action = decide screen
    let outMsg = { WindowTitle = msg.WindowTitle; Clicks = action }
    (Some outMsg, Some screen) </code></pre>
<p>Here is the spawn function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let decider = actorOfStatefulConvert decisionActor None clickerRef</code></pre>
<p>where <code>None</code> represents the initial state.</p>
<h2 id="button-clicker">Button Clicker</h2>
<p>Clicker actor has the simplest implementation because it does not send messages to other actors.
Here is the message that it receives from Decision Maker:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type ClickTarget = (int * int * int * int)
type ClickerMessage = {
  WindowTitle: string
  Clicks: ClickTarget[]
}</code></pre>
<p>The domain function has the simple type <code>ClickerMessage -&gt; unit</code> with mouse
clicks as side effect. You can read more about the mouse movements in 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/building-a-poker-bot-mouse-movements/">Part 3</a>
of these series.</p>
<p><a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/#MessageSink">Message Sink</a>
pattern is used for this actor, so actor function isn&#39;t
really needed. We spawn the singleton instance with the following statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let clickerRef = actorOfSink click |&gt; spawn system &quot;clicker-actor&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Actor goes under supervision by actor system with <code>click</code> as message handler.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The top layer of poker player application is composed of small single-purpose
actors which talk to each other by sending messages. </p>
<p>Thanks to succinct F# language and functional actor patterns this layer is
very thin, and thus easy to understand and maintain. </p>
<p>The business logic is isolated and by itself has no dependency on Akka.NET.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/'>Functional Actor Patterns with Akka.NET and F#</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>My exploration of Actor model started with <a href="http://getakka.net">Akka.NET</a> framework - a .NET port of
JVM-based <a href="http://akka.io">Akka</a>. Actor programming model made a lot of sense to me, but once
I started playing with it, some questions arose. Most of those questions were related to the
following <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.2/general/actors.html">definition</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An actor is a container for <code>State</code>, <code>Behavior</code>, a <code>Mailbox</code>, <code>Children</code> and a <code>Supervisor Strategy</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, based on the <a href="https://github.com/petabridge/akka-bootcamp">Akka.NET Bootcamp</a> course I understood that
an Actor</p>
<ul>
<li>knows what kind of messages it can accept</li>
<li>does some processing of each message</li>
<li>holds some state which is changed during message processing</li>
<li>potentially changes its behavior based on the current state</li>
<li>creates and stores references to child actors</li>
<li>obtains references to other actors</li>
<li>sends messages to children and other actors</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&#39;s nice that the framework enables us to develop for different aspects of actor 
behavior, it might also be dangerous in case you do all the things in one place. Ball of spaghetti mud
was where I ended up during my first attempt. My actors were doing all the things from 
the above list and the code got messy very quick. So, the following questions popped up
in my head:</p>
<p><em>How do I avoid mixing several concerns in one piece of code?</em></p>
<p><em>How do I make the code easily testable?</em></p>
<p><em>How do I minimize the usage of mutable state?</em></p>
<p><em>How do I avoid boilerplate code when it&#39;s not needed?</em></p>
<h2 id="functional-actors">Functional Actors</h2>
<p>I am now developing the actor-based application in F#, the functional first
language. Functions are easy to reason about, reusable and testable. But the
actors are usually defined in terms of objects and classes. F# supports classes
but that&#39;s not the path that I&#39;m willing to go.</p>
<p>How do we make actors out of functions? Well, most of the time actors don&#39;t 
need all the features of the framework. In this case we can define the required actor
behavior in terms of a minimal function and then use creational patterns to
spawn actor instances out of it.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at some common patterns that I identified. For each pattern, I will
define </p>
<ul>
<li>an example of a core function which implements the business logic</li>
<li>a generic function to create actors with behavior of a core function</li>
<li>an example of actor instantiation using the two functions above</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><a name="MessageSink" href="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/undefined"></a></p>
<h2 id="message-sink">Message Sink</h2>
<p>Stateless Message Sink is the simplest type of actor.</p>
<p><img src="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp//messagesink.png" alt="Message Sink actor"></p>
<p>It receives a message and executes some action on it. The action is not related
to any other actors, and there is no state, so the processing of each message
is always the same. Obviously, it&#39;s related to some kind of side effects:
logging the message, saving the data to the external storage and so on.</p>
<p>So, we don&#39;t need the majority of actor features in this case. The whole actor
processing could be represented by a function of type <code>&#39;a -&gt; unit</code>. Here 
is an example of a core function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let print msg =
  printn &quot;Message received: %A&quot; msg</code></pre>
<p>So how do we make an actor out of this function? Well, it&#39;s already implemented
as <code>actorOf</code> helper function in Akka.NET F# extensions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let actorOfSink (f : &#39;a -&gt; unit) = actorOf f</code></pre>
<p>And here is how we spawn an actor instance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let printActorRef = 
  actorOfSink print 
  |&gt; spawn system &quot;print-actor&quot;

printActorRef &lt;! 3
// &quot;Message received: 3&quot; is printed</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s the simplicity that I&#39;m searching for. Let&#39;s look at a slightly more
complex example.</p>
<hr>
<p><a name="Converter" href="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/undefined"></a></p>
<h2 id="converter">Converter</h2>
<p>Stateless Converter maps the incoming message into another message and sends
it to another predefined actor.</p>
<p><img src="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp//converter.png" alt="Converter actor"></p>
<p>The core of this actor is a classic function with one input and one output
parameter (type <code>&#39;a - &#39;b</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let square msg =
  msg * msg</code></pre>
<p>The actor function is similar to the one of Message Sink, but it also accepts
a reference to the output actor and knows how to send messages to it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let actorOfConvert f outputRef =
  actorOf2 (fun _ msg -&gt; outputRef &lt;! f msg)</code></pre>
<p>Here is how we spawn an instance of a Converter using our <code>print-actor</code> as the
output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let squareActorRef = 
  actorOfConvert square printActorRef 
  |&gt; spawn system &quot;square-actor&quot;

squareActorRef &lt;! 3
// &quot;Message received: 9&quot; is printed</code></pre>
<p>Both actor patterns had no notion of state so far. Let&#39;s see how we can 
treat the statefulness in a functional way.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="stateful-sink">Stateful Sink</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s get back to our Message Sink actor with side-effects, and make it
dependent on its internal state. The state is affected by the incoming 
messages and is preserved until the next message comes in.</p>
<p><img src="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp//statefulsink.png" alt="Stateful Sink actor"></p>
<p>Does not look very functional, right? But this impression is wrong in fact.
We can represent the state before a message came in - as an extra input parameter, 
and  the state after the message got processed - as an output parameter. 
We start with an initial state and the output of the
first message becomes the input state of the second message:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp//statefulsinkfunctional.png" alt="Stateful Sink functional actor"></p>
<p>Here is an example of a function which prints out the index of a message together
with the message contents:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let printIndex index msg =
  printn &quot;Message [%i] received: %A&quot; index msg
  index + 1</code></pre>
<p>For the actor implementation we need a recursive function so we can&#39;t use 
<code>actorOf2</code> anymore. Actor workflow is a bit more lines but still very simple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let actorOfStatefulSink f initialState (mailbox : Actor&lt;&#39;a&gt;) =

  let rec imp lastState =
    actor {
      let! msg = mailbox.Receive()
      let newState = f msg lastState
      return! imp newState
    }

  imp initialState</code></pre>
<p>And here is a usage example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let printIndexActorRef = 
  actorOfSink printIndex 1
  |&gt; spawn system &quot;print-ix-actor&quot;

printActorRef &lt;! 3
// &quot;Message [1] received: 3&quot; is printed

printActorRef &lt;! 4
// &quot;Message [2] received: 4&quot; is printed</code></pre>
<hr>
<p><a name="StatefulConverter" href="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/undefined"></a></p>
<h2 id="stateful-converter">Stateful Converter</h2>
<p>By now, the core function of the Stateful Converter actor should be a no-brainer for you. The actor
would have two input parameters and two outputs (in a tuple). One of the outputs
is a message and goes to another actor, the other output becomes an input for the
next actor:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp//statefulconverter.png" alt="Stateful Converter actor"></p>
<p>Here is a function which squares the messaged number, then calculates the running total
and sends it forward:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let squareAndSum sum msg =
  let result = sum + msg*msg
  (result, result)</code></pre>
<p>In this particular case the output message and state are equal, but they don&#39;t
have to be. Here is the actor implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let actorOfStatefulConvert f initialState outputRef (mailbox : Actor&lt;&#39;a&gt;) =

  let rec imp lastState =
    actor {
      let! msg = mailbox.Receive()
      let (result, newState) = f msg lastState
      outputRef &lt;! result
      return! imp newState
    }

  imp initialState</code></pre>
<p>And a usage example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let squareAndSumActorRef = 
  actorOfConvert square 0 printIndexActorRef 
  |&gt; spawn system &quot;square-sum-actor&quot;

squareAndSumActorRef &lt;! 3
// &quot;Message [1] received: 9&quot; is printed

squareAndSumActorRef &lt;! 4
// &quot;Message [2] received: 25&quot; is printed</code></pre>
<hr>
<p><a name="ConverterSupervisor" href="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/undefined"></a></p>
<h2 id="converter-supervisor">Converter-Supervisor</h2>
<p>In the previous patterns the Converter actors were sending messages 
to predefined actor references which were not managed (or supervised in Akka terms)
by those actors. Now, let&#39;s say that the actor needs to create a child
to send converted messages to it afterwards: </p>
<p><img src="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp//supervisedchild.png" alt="Supervised Child actor"></p>
<p>We can treat such child reference as the state and instantiate it when the first message
comes in. (We can&#39;t spawn it before the first message because the
<code>mailbox</code> object is required.) The message goes to the actor
reference that we store in the state, something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp//childasstate.png" alt="Supervised Child as State"></p>
<p>Here is the generic actor implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let actorOfConvertToChild f spawnChild (mailbox : Actor&lt;&#39;a&gt;) =

  let rec imp state =
    actor {
      let newstate =
        match state with
        | Some s -&gt; s
        | None -&gt; spawnChild mailbox

      let! msg = mailbox.Receive()
      newstate &lt;! f msg
      return! imp (Some newstate)
    }

  imp None</code></pre>
<p>The only difference is that we accept a <code>spawnChild</code> function instead of
pre-baked actor reference. Here is the first calculator example refactored
to Print actor being a child of Square actor.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let squareWithChildRef = 
  actorOfConvertToChild print (spawnChild square &quot;print-actor&quot;)
  |&gt; spawn system &quot;square-with-child-actor&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the <code>square</code> and <code>print</code> functions have exactly the same signatures
and implementations as we used before, and the concern of actor hierarchy is 
completely separated from the business logic of the actors.</p>
<p>This hierarchy is handy whenever you need multiple instances of one actor type
(<code>f</code>-actor from the picture) and corresponding instances of another actor type
(<code>g</code>-actor):</p>
<p><img src="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp//multiparents.png" alt="Multiple Parents and Children actor"></p>
<hr>
<p><a name="RouterSupervisor" href="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/undefined"></a></p>
<h2 id="router-supervisor">Router-Supervisor</h2>
<p>Routers are the kind of actors which forward each incoming message to one
or more downstream actors. In this example the downstream actors are supervised
by the Router itself.
So, the Router-Supervisor can have multiple children and send the result of 
message processing to one or more of them:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp//router.png" alt="Router actor"></p>
<p>To keep the spirit of functional actors, we represent the router logic with a function
of type <code>&#39;a -&gt; seq&lt;string * &#39;b&gt;</code>, where <code>&#39;a</code> is the type of incoming messages,
<code>&#39;b</code> is the type of outgoing messages, and <code>string</code> represents the identifier of the 
actor to get the message. Here is a sample implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let routeSensorData msg = 
  msg |&gt; Seq.map (fun x -&gt; (&quot;sensor-actor-&quot; + x.SensorId, x.Temperature))</code></pre>
<p>Based on the incoming metadata (sensor identifier) the actor forwards its
temperature to corresponding sensor-specific actor. </p>
<p>Here is the implementation of the generic actor function:</p>
<pre><code>let actorOfRouteToChildren f spawnChild (mailbox : Actor&lt;&#39;a&gt;) =

  let getActor id = 
    let actorRef = mailbox.Context.Child(id)
    if actorRef.IsNobody() then
      spawnChild id mailbox
    else 
      actorRef

  let rec imp () =
    actor {
      let! msg = mailbox.Receive()
      f msg |&gt; Seq.iter (fun (id, x) -&gt; (getActor id) &lt;! x) 
      return! imp ()
    }

  imp ()</code></pre><p>And a usage example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let sensorRouterRef = 
  actorOfRouteToChildren routeSensorData (spawnChild square)
  |&gt; spawn system &quot;route-sensor-actor&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>spawnChild</code> does not accept the child ID anymore because it&#39;s being
controlled by the router itself.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With the patterns that we have so far we should be able to build quite powerful
hierarchies like the one shown below:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp//usecase.png" alt="Actor use case"></p>
<p>There might be many other scenarios and types of actors that would make sense
in your use case. I&#39;m just showing the basic patterns, but more importantly the way of 
reasoning about the code. Don&#39;t 
let the multitude of actor aspects push you into the world of poorly structured 
code.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2016/03/aurelia-map-component-with-leaflet/'>Aurelia Map Component with Leaflet</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>This is a short tutorial on how to create a map control in <a href="http://aurelia.io">Aurelia.js</a> 
application. I am using the <a href="http://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a> library with custom tile
source and I also show the way to implement your own overlay layer. Here is what
my map looks like:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/03/aurelia-map-component-with-leaflet//map.png" alt="Map"></p>
<p>So, I assume you already have an existing Aurelia application, and let&#39;s start.</p>
<h2 id="install-leaflet">Install Leaflet</h2>
<p>The following command will install Leaflet module to the application:</p>
<pre><code>jspm install leaflet</code></pre><p>If you are using TypeScript, don&#39;t forget to add type definitions</p>
<pre><code>tsd install leaflet</code></pre><h2 id="define-a-map-component">Define a Map Component</h2>
<p>Create a new <code>map.html</code> file and put the following contents there:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;require from=&quot;leaflet/dist/leaflet.css&quot;&gt;&lt;/require&gt;
  &lt;div id=&quot;mapid&quot; style=&quot;height: 100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;</code></pre>
<p>We import the CSS required by leaflet and define the <code>div</code> element to host
the map in. Then, create a new <code>map.js</code> file (or <code>map.ts</code> for typescript),
here is the minimum code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class Map {
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="load-the-map-with-tiles">Load the Map with Tiles</h2>
<p>First, import the leaflet module in your codebehind:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import * as L from &#39;leaflet&#39;;</code></pre>
<p>Now, define the <code>attached</code> function, which would be called by Aurelia when
control&#39;s HTML is loaded, and make a map there:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">export class Map {
  attached() {
    let map = L.map(&#39;mapid&#39;).setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);

    let urlTemplate = &#39;http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png&#39;;
    map.addLayer(L.tileLayer(urlTemplate, { minZoom: 4 }));
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>The example above uses the URL template of Open Street Maps as per the Leaflet&#39;s
tutorial, but I needed to use our privately hosted maps, so I changed it to
something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">let urlTemplate = &#39;http://www.mysite.com/tiles?layer=background&amp;level={z}&amp;x={x}&amp;y={y}&#39;;
map.addLayer(L.tileLayer(urlTemplate, { minZoom: 4, zoomOffset: 8 }));</code></pre>
<p>The <code>zoomOffset</code> parameter was required to fix impedance mismatch of zoom levels.</p>
<h2 id="custom-overlay-layer">Custom Overlay Layer</h2>
<p>For our custom maps we needed to show two layers on top of each other:</p>
<ul>
<li>The usual tile layer for the map background</li>
<li>The overlay layer for the map labels and additional information</li>
</ul>
<p>The overlay layer can&#39;t be broken down into tiles (not supported by our map provider),
so we need to show the whole layer as a single picture and then refresh it every
time user pans or zooms the map.</p>
<p>The overlay layer can be implemented with <code>onAdd</code> and <code>onRemove</code> functions
and then feeding an image element to the Leaflet as a layer. Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import * as L from &#39;leaflet&#39;;

export class LabelOverlayLayer {
  map;
  image;

  onAdd(map) {

    let tileUrl = `http://www.mysite.com/tiles?layer=labels&amp;lonmin=${nw.lng}&amp;latmin=${se.lat}&amp;lonmax=${se.lng}&amp;latmax=${nw.lat}&amp;width=${Math.floor(mapSize.x)}&amp;height=${Math.floor(mapSize.y)}`;

<p>The usage of this layer in the map component is trivial:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">this.map.addLayer(new LabelOverlayLayer());</code></pre>
<h2 id="use-the-map-component">Use the Map Component</h2>
<p>The map component is ready to be used in the application:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;require from=&quot;./components/map&quot;&gt;&lt;/require&gt;
&lt;div  style=&quot;height: 700px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;map&gt;&lt;/map&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The container around the map should have a non-zero height, so I made it fixed
in the example above.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t forget to bundle the leaflet assets by including the following lines
into your <code>bundles.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;includes&quot;: [
  &quot;aurelia-framework&quot;,
  // ...
  &quot;leaflet&quot;,
  &quot;leaflet/dist/leaflet.css!text&quot;
],</code></pre>
