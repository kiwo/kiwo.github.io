    <h1><a href='/2016/08/comparing-scala-to-fsharp/'>Comparing Scala to F#</a></h1>
    

    

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>F# and Scala are quite similar languages from 10.000 feet view. Both are
functional-first languages developed for the virtual machines where imperative
languages dominate. C# for .NET and Java for JVM are still <em>lingua franca</em>, 
but alternatives are getting stronger.</p>
<p>My background is in .NET ecosystem, so F# was the first of the two that I started
learning. At the same time, Scala seems to have more traction, largely due to
successful products and frameworks like Spark, Akka and Play. That&#39;s why I decided
to broaden my skill set and pick up some Scala knowledge. I&#39;ve started with 
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/scala">Functional Programming in Scala Specialization</a> at Coursera.
While following the coursera, I&#39;m doing some notes about which language features
in Scala I find interesting, or vice versa - missing compared to F#.</p>
<p>In no particular order, I want to share my notes of Scala vs F# in this blog post.</p>
<p><em>Post updated based on comments by Mark Lewis and Giacomo Citi.</em></p>
<h2 id="implicit-parameters">Implicit Parameters</h2>
<p>A parameter of a function can be marked as implicit</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">def work(implicit i:Int) = print(i)</code></pre>
<p>and that means you can call the function without specifying the value for this parameter
and the compiler will try to figure out that value you (according to
the extensive set of rules), e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">implicit val v = 2;
// ... somewhere below
work // prints &#39;2&#39;</code></pre>
<p>I am not aware of any similar features in other language that I know, so I&#39;m pretty sure
I don&#39;t understand it well enough yet :) At the same time, I think implicits are
very characteristic for Scala: they are a powerful tool, which can be used in many
valid scenarios, or can be abused to shoot in one&#39;s feet.</p>
<h2 id="underscore-in-lambdas">Underscore In Lambdas</h2>
<p>Underscores <code>_</code> can be used to represent parameters in lambda expressions
without explicitly naming them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">employees.sortBy(_.dateOfBirth)</code></pre>
<p>I think that&#39;s brilliant - very short and readable. Tuple values are represented
by <code>_1</code> and <code>_2</code>, so we can sort an array of tuples like</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">profitByYear.sortBy(_._1)</code></pre>
<p>This looks a bit hairy and should probably be used only when the meaning is obvious.
(In the example above I&#39;m not sure if we sort by year or by profit...)</p>
<p>In F# underscore is used in a different sense - as &quot;something to ignore&quot;. That makes
sense, but I would love to have a shorter way of writing lambda in</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">empoyees |&gt; List.sort (fun e -&gt; e.dateOfBirth)</code></pre>
<p>Any hint how?</p>
<h2 id="tail-recursion-mark">Tail-Recursion Mark</h2>
<p>Any recursive function in Scala can be marked with <code>@tailrec</code> annotation,
which would result in compilation error if the function is not tail-recursive.
This guarantees that you won&#39;t get a nasty stack overflow exception. </p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">@tailrec 
def boom(x: Int): Int = {
  if (x == 0) 0
  else boom(x-1) + 1
}</code></pre>
<p>The code above won&#39;t compile, as the recursion can&#39;t be optimized by the
compiler.</p>
<p>The feature sounds very reasonable, although I must admit that I have 
never needed it in <em>my</em> F# code yet.</p>
<h2 id="call-by-name">Call By Name</h2>
<p>When you call a function in F#, the parameter values are evaluated before
the function body. This style of function substitution model is known as
Call by Value.</p>
<p>Same is the default in Scala. But there is an alternative: you can defer the
evaluation of parameters by marking them with an <code>=&gt;</code> symbol:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">def callByName(x: =&gt; Int) = {
  println(&quot;x is &quot; + x)
}</code></pre>
<p>This style is known as Call by Name, and the evaluation is defered until the
parameter is actually used. So, if parameter is never used, its value
will never be evaluated. This code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">val a:Option[Int] = Some(1)
val b = a getOrElse (2/0)</code></pre>
<p>will set <code>b</code> to <code>1</code>, and no error will be thrown, even though we are dividing by zero 
in function parameter. This is because the parameter of <code>getOrElse</code> is passed
by name.</p>
<p>The F# alternative <code>defaultArg</code> doesn&#39;t work this way, so the following code
will blow up:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let a = Some(1)
let b = defaultArg b (2/0) // boom</code></pre>
<p>You can get deferred evaluation by passing a function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let defaultArgFunc o (f: unit -&gt; &#39;a) = 
  match o with | Some v -&gt; v | None -&gt; f()

let b2 = defaultArgFunc a (fun () -&gt; 2 / 0)</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s essentially what happens in Scala too, but the Scala syntax is 
arguably cleaner.</p>
<h2 id="lack-of-type-inference">Lack of Type Inference</h2>
<p>Slowly moving towards language design flavours, I&#39;ll start with Type Inference.
In Scala, type inference seems to be quite limited. Yes, you don&#39;t have to
explicitly define the types of local values or (most of the time) function return
types, but that&#39;s about it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">def max (a: Int, b:Int) = if (a &gt; b) a else b</code></pre>
<p>You have to specify the types of all input parameters, and that&#39;s quite a bummer
for people who are used to short type-less code of F# (or Haskell, OCaml and others, 
for that matter).</p>
<p>Type inference in F# plays another significant role: automatic type generalization.
F# compiler would make types as generic as possible, based on implementation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let max a b = if a &gt; b then a else b</code></pre>
<p>The type of the function above is <code>&#39;a -&gt; &#39;a -&gt; &#39;a</code>. Most people wouldn&#39;t make
it generic from get-go, but compiler helps in this case.</p>
<h2 id="functional-vs-object-oriented-style">Functional vs Object-Oriented Style</h2>
<p>Both F# and Scala are running on top of managed object-oriented virtual machines,
and at the same time both languages enable developers to write functional code.
Functional programming means operating immutable data structures in pure, free of
side effects operations. Without questioning all this, I find pure functional 
Scala code to be written in much more object-oriented <em>style</em> compared to F#.</p>
<p>Classes and objects are ubiquitous in Scala: they are in each example given 
in Martin Odersky&#39;s courses. Most F# examples refrain from classes unless needed.
F# official guidance is to never expose non-abstract classes from F# API!</p>
<p>Scala is really heavy about inheritance. They even introduced quasi-multiple inheritance:
traits. <code>Stream</code> inherits from <code>List</code>, and <code>Nothing</code> is a subtype of every other type, 
to be used for some covariance tricks.</p>
<p>Operations are usually defined as class methods instead of separate functions. For
example the following Scala code</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">word filter (c =&gt; c.isLetter)</code></pre>
<p>would filter a string to letters only. Why is <code>isLetter</code> defined as a method of 
<code>Char</code>? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s essential for the type itself...</p>
<h2 id="usage-of-operators">Usage of Operators</h2>
<p>It looks like Scala culture inclines more towards the usage of different
operators, not only for arithmetic operations but also for different classes
from standard library and domain-specific code too. The basic ones are nice,
e.g. list concatenation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">List(1, 2) ++ List(3, 4)</code></pre>
<p>but others look awkward to me, e.g. stream concatenation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">Stream(1) #::: Stream(2)</code></pre>
<p>Akka streams sweetness:</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">in ~&gt; f1 ~&gt; bcast ~&gt; f2 ~&gt; merge ~&gt; f3 ~&gt; out
            bcast ~&gt; f4 ~&gt; merge</code></pre>
<p>This can go to quite an extreme, similar to what <code>scalaz</code> library does.</p>
<p>My default would be not to use operators unless you are sure that every 
reader is able to instantly understand what it means.</p>
<h2 id="partial-application">Partial Application</h2>
<p>Not a huge difference, but F# functions are curried by default, while Scala
functions aren&#39;t. Thus, in F# partial application just works, all the time</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let add a b = a + b
let add3 = add 3
let sum = add3 5 // 8</code></pre>
<p>Scala function </p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">def add (a: Int, b: Int) = a + b</code></pre>
<p>is not curried, but Underscore comes to the rescue</p>
<pre><code class="language-scala">val add3: (Int) =&gt; Int = add(3, _)
val sum = add3(5) // 8</code></pre>
<p>Note how I miss the type inference again.</p>
<p>The parameter order is very important in F#: the short syntax
will partially apply parameters from left to right. In Scala, you can
put <code>_</code> at any position, which gives you some flexibility.</p>
<h2 id="single-direction-dependency">Single-Direction Dependency</h2>
<p>F# compiler doesn&#39;t allow circular dependencies. You can&#39;t use a function 
before you&#39;ve defined it. Here is what Expert F# book has to say about
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Managing dependencies and circularity is one of the most difficult 
and fundamental problems in good software design. The files in 
an F# project are presented to the F# compiler in a compilation 
order: constructs in the earlier files can&#39;t refer to declarations 
in the later files. This is a mechanism to enforce layered design, 
where software is carefully organized into layers, and where one 
layer doesn&#39;t refer to other layers in a cyclic way (...) to help you 
write code that is reusable and organized 
into components that are, where possible, independent and not 
combined into a &quot;tangle&quot; of &quot;spaghetti code&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is huge. F# forces you to structure your code in a way that
avoid mutual dependencies between different functions, types and modules.
This reduces the complexity and coupling, makes the developers avoid some
of the design pitfalls.</p>
<p>There&#39;s nothing like that in Scala. You are on your own.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Of course I did not cover all the distinctions, for instance active patterns, 
type providers, computation expressions in F# and type classes, higher 
kinded types, macros in Scala.</p>
<p>Obviously, both Scala and F# are very capable languages, and I am still
picking up the basics of them. While similar in many aspects, they made
several different choices along the language design trade-offs.</p>
<p>P.S. Overheard on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>F# isn&#39;t a bad language, it&#39;s just attached to a bad platform... 
The opposite of Scala actually.</p>
</blockquote>

    <h1><a href='/2016/07/mocking-api-calls-in-aurelia/'>Mocking API calls in Aurelia</a></h1>
    

    

    <div class="post-content">
        <p><a href="http://aurelia.io">Aurelia</a> is a modern and slick single-page application framework. 
&quot;Single-page application&quot; aspect means that it&#39;s loaded
into the browser once, and then the navigation happens on the client side and
all the data are loaded from a REST API endpoint.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say that our front-end Aurelia app is hosted at
<code>myaureliaapp.com</code> while the REST API is hosted at
<code>myaureliaapp.com/api</code>. The REST API is a server-side application,
which can be implemented in .NET, Java, Node.JS etc., and it talks to
a database of some kinds.</p>
<p>For the front-end development purpose, it&#39;s usually useful to be able to
mock the connection to API with some static manually generated data. This
cuts the hard dependency between the client code, the backend code and database.
It&#39;s much easier to mock the exact data set which is needed for the current
development task.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it can be easily done, and here is how.</p>
<h2 id="identify-your-requests">Identify your requests</h2>
<p>Create a list of the requests that you need to mock. For our example let&#39;s
say you do the following requests from the application:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products
GET /api/products/{id}
POST /api/products</code></pre><h2 id="put-your-mock-data-into-files">Put your mock data into files</h2>
<p>Go to the root folder of your Aurelia app and create an <code>/api</code> folder. </p>
<p>Create a <code>/api/products</code> subfolder and put a new file called <code>GET.json</code>. This
file should contain the JSON of the product list, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">[ { &quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Keyboard&quot;, &quot;price&quot;: &quot;60$&quot; },
  { &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mouse&quot;, &quot;price&quot;: &quot;20$&quot; },
  { &quot;id&quot;: 3, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Headphones&quot;, &quot;price&quot;: &quot;80$&quot; }
]</code></pre>
<p>Create a new file called <code>POST.json</code> in the same folder. POST response won&#39;t 
return any data, so the file can be as simple as</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{}</code></pre>
<p>Create subfolders <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> under <code>products</code> and create a <code>GET.json</code> 
file in each of them. Every file contains the data for a specific product, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{ &quot;id&quot;: 1, 
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Keyboard&quot;, 
  &quot;price&quot;: &quot;60$&quot;,
  &quot;category&quot;: &quot;Computer Accessories&quot;,
  &quot;brand&quot;: &quot;Mousytech&quot;
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="configure-browsersync-to-mock-your-api-calls">Configure BrowserSync to mock your API calls</h2>
<p>For the purpose of this post, I assume you are using 
<a href="https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation">Aurelia Skeleton Navigation</a>
starter kit, specifically 
<a href="https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation/tree/master/skeleton-esnext">the version with Gulp-based tasks and BrowserSync</a>.
If so, you should be familiar with <code>gulp serve</code> command, which serves your 
application at <code>http://localhost:9000</code>. We will extend this command to host
your API mock too.</p>
<p>Navigate to <code>/build/tasks</code> folder and edit the <code>serve.js</code> file. Change the 
definition of <code>serve</code> task to the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">gulp.task(&#39;serve&#39;, [&#39;build&#39;], function(done) {
  browserSync({
    online: false,
    open: false,
    port: 9000,
    server: {
      baseDir: [&#39;.&#39;],
      middleware: function(req, res, next) {
        res.setHeader(&#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&#39;, &#39;*&#39;);

        // Mock API calls
        if (req.url.indexOf(&#39;/api/&#39;) &gt; -1) {
          console.log(&#39;[serve] responding &#39; + req.method + &#39; &#39; + req.originalUrl);

          var jsonResponseUri = req._parsedUrl.pathname + &#39;/&#39; + req.method + &#39;.json&#39;;

          // Require file for logging purpose, if not found require will 
          // throw an exception and middleware will cancel the retrieve action
          var jsonResponse = require(&#39;../..&#39; + jsonResponseUri);

          // Replace the original call with retrieving json file as reply
          req.url = jsonResponseUri;
          req.method = &#39;GET&#39;;
        }

        next();
      }
    }
  }, done);
});</code></pre>
<h2 id="run-it">Run it</h2>
<p>Now just run <code>gulp serve</code> (or <code>gulp watch</code>, which does <code>serve</code> and then watches
files for changes). Every time your app makes an API call, you will see
a line in the gulp console:</p>
<pre><code>[serve] responding GET /api/products</code></pre><p>If you happen to make an invalid request with no mock defined, you will
get an error:</p>
<pre><code>[serve] responding GET /api/notproducts
Error: Cannot find module &#39;../../api/notproducts/GET.json&#39;</code></pre><p>A complete example can be found in 
<a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/mikhailio-samples/tree/master/aurelia-api-mocks">my github repository</a>.</p>

</ul>
<p>In this post I describe a simple pattern to structure the complex decision making
code using partial function application and fold operation applied to a list of functions.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>Poker decisions are complex and depend on the multitude of parameters and attributes.
We can visualize the decision making process as a Decision Tree where leaf nodes are
decisions being made, and the branches are different conditions. Here is a simplistic
example of such a poker decision tree:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/07/building-a-poker-bot-functional-fold-as-decision-tree-pattern//simple-poker-decision-tree.png" alt="Simplistic Poker Decision Tree"></p>
<p>Now, if we need to implement a similar tree in code, the most straightforward way to
do that is to translate each condition to an <code>if</code> statement. This way, the nested
conditions will guide the application through the branches right to the point where
an appropriate decision can be returned.</p>
<p>This approach works for small cases, but in reality it does not scale particularly 
well in terms of the tree size. Namely, the two problems are:</p>
<p><strong>Tree depth</strong>. In many cases, you might need to pass ten or more conditions before
you find your way to the leaf. Obviously, ten levels of <code>if</code> statements are not
particularly readable and maintainable. We can try to split the sub-trees into
sub-functions, but that only gives a limited relief.</p>
<p><strong>Subtree correlation</strong>. Some tree branches deep down the hiereachy might be correlated
to each other. Say, you pass 10 levels of conditions and make a bet on flop. Now,
on turn, you would probably take quite a different decision path, but the logic
would be based on similar &#39;thinking&#39; in human terms. Ideally, we want to keep this
kind of related decisions together, while isolating them from the other unrelated
decision paths.</p>
<p>In fact, the decision tree should be generalized to the Decision <em>Graph</em> to allow
different decision branches to merge back at some point, e.g.</p>

<p>If there is one Ace on flop, or an overcard came on turn or river</p>
<p>and stacks pre-flop were 20+ BB, or 12+ BB in limped pot</p>
<p>then bet 75% of the pot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are multiple paths to the same decisions.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p><strong>Break the decision graph down</strong> vertically into smaller chunks. Each chunk should
represent multiple layers of conditions and lead to eventual decisions. All
conditions in sub-graph should be related to each other (high cohesion) and as 
isolated from other sub-graphs as possible (low coupling).</p>
<p>Here are two examples of such sub-graphs:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/07/building-a-poker-bot-functional-fold-as-decision-tree-pattern//decision-subgraphs.png" alt="Isolated Decision Sub-graphs"></p>
<p>Each sub-graph is very focused on very specific paths and ignores all the branches
which do not belong to this decision process. The idea is that those branches
will be handled by other sub-graphs.</p>
<p><strong>Represent each sub-graph as a function</strong> with arbitrary signature which accepts
all the parameters that are required for this sub-graph. Do not accept any parameters
which are not related. </p>
<p>The last parameter of each function should be a 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/01/monads-explained-in-csharp/#maybe">Maybe</a> of Decision,
so should be the function&#39;s return type.</p>
<p><strong>Produce a flat list</strong> of all the sub-graph functions. Partially apply the parameters
to those functions to unify the signature of all of them.</p>
<p>Now, when making a decision, <strong>left-fold the list of functions</strong> with the data of
current poker hand. If a function returns <code>Some</code> value of decision, return it
as the decision produced from the graph.</p>
<h2 id="code-sample">Code sample</h2>
<p>We define a number of functions, each one of which represents one piece of decision 
logic. Then we put them all into the list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let rules = [
  overtakeLimpedPot overtakyHand snapshot value history;
  increaseTurnBetEQvsAI snapshot;
  allInTurnAfterCheckRaiseInLimpedPot snapshot history;
  checkCallPairedTurnAfterCallWithSecondPairOnFlop snapshot value.Made history;
  bluffyCheckRaiseFlopInLimpedPotFlop bluffyCheckRaiseFlopsLimp snapshot value history;
  bluffyOvertakingRiver bluffyOvertaking snapshot history
]</code></pre>
<p>The type of this list is <code>(Decision option -&gt; Decision option) list</code>.</p>
<p>Note how each individual function accepts different set of parameters. Current hand&#39;s
<code>snapshot</code> is used by all of them, while calculated hand <code>value</code> and previous
action <code>history</code> are used only by some of the functions. </p>
<p>Now, here is the definition of the facade decision making function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">rules |&gt; List.fold (fun opt rule -&gt; rule opt) None</code></pre>
<p>It calculates the decision by folding the list of rules and passing current decision
between them. <code>None</code> is the initial seed of the fold.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Vertical slices are an efficient way to break down the complex decision making
into smaller cohesive manageable parts. Once you get the parts right, it&#39;s easy
to compose them by folding a flat list of partially applied functions into a
<code>Maybe</code> of decision result.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2016/05/dependency-inversion-implies-interfaces-are-owned-by-high-level-modules/'>Dependency Inversion Implies Interfaces Are Owned by High-level Modules</a></h1>
    

    

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Dependency Inversion is one of the five principles of widely known and 
acknowledged S.O.L.I.D. design guidelines. This principle is very powerful
and useful when applied consistently. But in my experience, it&#39;s actually
quite easy to misunderstand the idea, or at least to mentally simplify it
to somewhat less profound technique of Dependency Injection.</p>
<p>In this post I will try to give my understanding of the principle, and 
the difference between <em>Inversion</em> and <em>Injection</em>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the Dependency Inversion principle definition. It was given
by Uncle Bob Martin, and consists of two parts.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-abstractions">Part 1: Abstractions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. 
Both should depend on abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, this is easy to understand. High-level modules are also high-importance
modules, they are about the business domain and are not specific about
technical details. Low-level modules are about wiring those high-level
functions to execution environment, tools and third parties. </p>
<p>Thus, the implementation of high level policy should not depend on 
implementation of low level code, but rather on interfaces (or other
abstractions).</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take a look at an example. Our high-level business domain is about
planning and executing trips from geographical point A to point B. Our
low-level code talks to a service which knows how to calculate the time 
required for a vehicle to go from A to B:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/05/dependency-inversion-implies-interfaces-are-owned-by-high-level-modules//uml-dependency-inversion-violated.png" alt="UML: dependency inversion violated"></p>
<p>So the following code <strong>violates</strong> the first part of the Dependency Inversion:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">namespace Mapping
{
    public class RouteCalculator
    {
        public TimeSpan CalculateDuration(
            double fromLat, double fromLng, double toLat, double toLng)
        {
            // Call a 3rd party web service
        }
    }
}

namespace Planning
{
    public class TripPlanner
    {
        public DateTime ExpectedArrival(Trip trip)
        {
            var calculator = new RouteCalculator();
            var duration = calculator.CalculateDuration(
                trip.Origin.Latitude, 
                trip.Origin.Longitude, 
                trip.Destination.Latitude, 
                trip.Destination.Longitude);
            return trip.Start.Add(duration);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s not compliant to the principle because the high-level code (<code>TripPlanner</code>)
explicitly depends on low-level service (<code>RouteCalculator</code>). Note that I&#39;ve put
them to distinct namespaces to emphasize the required separation.</p>
<p>To improve on that, we might introduce an interface to decouple the 
implementations:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/05/dependency-inversion-implies-interfaces-are-owned-by-high-level-modules//uml-dependency-inversion-with-dependency-injection.png" alt="UML: dependency inversion with dependency injection"></p>
<p>In Trip Planner we accept the interface as constructor parameter, and we&#39;ll get the 
specific implementation at run time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">namespace Mapping
{
    public class IRouteCalculator
    {
        TimeSpan CalculateDuration(
            double fromLat, double fromLng, double toLat, double toLng);
    }

    public class RouteCalculator : IRouteCalculator
    {
        // Same implementation as before...
    }
}

namespace Planning
{
    public class TripPlanner
    {
        private IRouteCalculator calculator;

        public TripPlanner(IRouteCalculator calculator)
        {
            this.calculator = calculator;
        }

        public DateTime ExpectedArrival(Trip trip)
        {
            var duration = this.calculator.CalculateDuration(
                trip.Origin.Latitude, 
                trip.Origin.Longitude, 
                trip.Destination.Latitude, 
                trip.Destination.Longitude);
            return trip.Start.Add(duration);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This technique is called <em>dependency 
injection</em> or, more specifically, <em>constructor injection</em>. This way 
we can easily substitute the implementation later or inject a test 
double while unit testing.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s just one part of the principle. Let&#39;s move on to part 2.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-details">Part 2: Details</h2>
<p>The second part of the principle says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstractions should not depend upon details. 
Details should depend upon abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find this wording unfortunate because it might be confusing. There are 
some valid examples which explain it with base and derived classes. 
But in our example we solved the part 1 with an interface. So now we are told that
the abstraction (interface) should not depend upon details (implementation).</p>
<p>That probably means that the interface should not leak any entities which
are specific to the given implementation, to make other implementation
equally possible.</p>
<p>While this is try, this second part of the principle may seem to be subordinate
to part one, reducing to an idea &quot;design your interfaces well&quot;. So 
many people tend to leave the part 2 out (
<a href="https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#dependency-inversion-principle">example 1</a>,
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/495019/Dependency-Inversion-Principle-and-the-Dependency">example 2</a>), focusing 
solely on part 1 - the Dependency Injection.</p>
<h2 id="interface-ownership">Interface Ownership</h2>
<p>But Dependency Inversion is <strong>not</strong> just Dependency Injection. So, to revive
the part 2 I would add the following statement to make it clearer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstractions should be owned by higher-level modules and implemented by
lower-level modules.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule is violated in our last example. The interface is defined together
with implementation, and is basically just extracted from it. It&#39;s <strong>owned</strong>
by the mapping namespace. </p>
<p>To improve the design, we can transfer the interface ownership to domain
level:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/05/dependency-inversion-implies-interfaces-are-owned-by-high-level-modules//uml-dependency-inversion.png" alt="UML: dependency inversion"></p>
<p>As you can see, I also renamed the interface. The name should reflect the way
how the domain experts would think of this abstraction. Here is the result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">namespace Planning
{
    public class IDurationCalculator
    {
        TimeSpan CalculateDuration(Hub origin, Hub destination);
    }

    public class TripPlanner
    {
        private IDurationCalculator calculator;

        public TripPlanner(IDurationCalculator calculator)
        {
            this.calculator = calculator;
        }

        public DateTime ExpectedArrival(Trip trip)
        {
            var duration = this.calculator.CalculateDuration(
                trip.Origin, trip.Destination);
            return trip.Start.Add(duration);
        }
    }
}

namespace Mapping
{
    public class RouteCalculator : IRouteCalculator
    {
        public TimeSpan CalculateDuration(Hub origin, Hub destination)
        {
            // Extract latitude and longitude from Hubs
            // Call a 3rd party web service
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, the interface is defined in <code>Planning</code> namespace, close to its <em>Client</em>,
not its <em>Implementation</em>. That&#39;s the dependency inversion in action. Even
more importantly, it&#39;s defined in terms of our domain - notice the use of
<code>Hub</code> in the interface instead of low-level <code>double</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why-high-level-code-should-own-interfaces">Why High Level Code Should Own Interfaces</h2>
<p>There are multiple benefits to this approach, here are the most important
advantages:</p>
<h3 id="concise-readable-high-level-code">Concise, readable high-level code</h3>
<p>The high-level domain code has the highest value, so the ultimate goal
is to keep it as clean as possible. The interface ownership enables us to
design the most concise interfaces to achieve this goal. We avoid any kind
of adaptation of domain entities to whatever lower-level details.</p>
<h3 id="better-abstractions">Better abstractions</h3>
<p>The interfaces themselves get better as well. They are closer to business,
so abstractions get more ubiquitous and better understood by everyone.</p>
<p>They tend to live longer, just because they are born from the domain side, 
not the infrastructure side.</p>
<h3 id="dependencies-in-outer-layers">Dependencies in outer layers</h3>
<p>Code organization tends to improve too. If an interface is defined in the 
same module as the implementation, the domain module now has
to reference the infrastructure module just to use the interface.</p>
<p>With domain-level interface, the reference goes in the other direction, so
dependencies are pushed up to the outer layers of application. </p>
<p>This principle is the foundation of domain-centric architectures
<a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Clean architecture</a>,
<a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Ports and Adapters</a> and the likes.</p>
<h3 id="less-cross-domain-dependencies">Less cross-domain dependencies</h3>
<p>In large systems, the business domains should be split into smaller sub-domains, or
bounded contexts. Still, sub-domains are not totally isolated and must 
cooperate to achieve the ultimate business goal. </p>
<p>It might be compelling to reference the interfaces of one sub-domain 
from another sub-domain and then say that the dependency is minimal because
they are hidden behind abstractions.</p>
<p>But coupling with abstractions is still coupling. Instead, each domain should
operate its own abstractions at the high level, and then different abstractions
should be wired together on lower level with techniques like adapters, facades,
context mapping etc.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Here is my working definition of Dependency Inversion principle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. 
Both should depend on abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstractions should not depend upon details. 
Details should depend upon abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstractions should be owned by higher-level modules and implemented by
lower-level modules.</p>
</blockquote>

    <h1><a href='/2016/05/tweaking-immutable-objects-with-csharp-and-fody/'>Tweaking immutable objects with C# and Fody</a></h1>
    

    

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Immutable data structures provide a lot of benefits
to programmers, especially when representing domain 
<a href="https://lostechies.com/joeocampo/2007/04/23/a-discussion-on-domain-driven-design-value-objects/">value objects</a>. 
Immutability is an essential part of functional programming paradigm.
The concept is useful in object-oriented languages too, but you have
to pay some price to get this advantage.</p>
<p>In C# immutable classes are usually implemented with read-only
properties which are populated from constructor parameters. One of the 
disadvantages of this approach is the verbosity of creating a copy of an object
with one property value modified.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s have a look at an illustration of this problem. Let&#39;s say we have a value
type representing poker player statistics:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class PlayerStats
{
    public PlayerStats(
        int hands, 
        int daysOnline,
        Money won, 
        Money expectedValue)
    {
        this.Hands = hands;
        this.DaysOnline = daysOnline;
        this.Won = won;
        this.ExpectedValue = expectedValue;
    }

    public int Hands { get; }
    public int DaysOnline { get; }
    public Money Won { get; }
    public Money ExpectedValue { get; }
}</code></pre>
<p>We already see that it&#39;s quite verbose: basically we repeat each property name
five times. But the issue I&#39;m discussing today is related to how we create 
a new object based on another object. Let&#39;s say we need to make a copy of 
a given statistics, but with <code>Hands</code> property increased by 1:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var increasedHands = new PlayerStats(
    existing.Hands + 1,
    existing.DaysOnline,
    existing.Won,
    existing.ExpectedValue);</code></pre>
<p>Not as simple as we could hope. Also, there is some room for mistakes here. For 
instance, we could swap <code>Won</code> and <code>ExpectedValue</code> property calls
and compiler won&#39;t let us know because the types are the same. So we probably
want to use explicit constructor parameter names:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var increasedHands = new PlayerStats(
    hands: existing.Hands + 1,
    daysOnline: existing.DaysOnline,
    won: existing.Won,
    expectedValue: existing.ExpectedValue);</code></pre>
<p>But that leads to even more typing and repetition...</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>F# is a functional-first language with immutability as first-class concept.
In F# value objects are usually modelled with Records, here is our example
reimplemented:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type PlayerStats = {
    Hands: int
    DaysOnline: int
    Won: Money
    ExpectedValue: Money
}</code></pre>
<p>Creation of new objects based on other objects is also solved properly in F#,
thanks to the <strong><code>with</code></strong> keyword :</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let increasedHands = { existing with Hands = existing.Hands + 1 }</code></pre>
<p>All the properties are copied from the source record except for the ones
explicitly mentioned in the expression.</p>
<h2 id="defining-with-in-c-">Defining With in C#</h2>
<p>There&#39;s no <strong><code>with</code></strong> operator in C#, but we can try to come up with an
alternative. We can define some fluent methods which would change
property values one by one (they don&#39;t change the original object, but
return a copy with changed value):</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public PlayerStats WithHands(int hands) 
{
    return new PlayerStats(
        hands: hands,
        daysOnline: existing.DaysOnline,
        won: existing.Won,
        expectedValue: existing.ExpectedValue);
}

public PlayerStats WithDaysOnline(int daysOnline) { ... }
public PlayerStats WithWon(Money won) { ... }
public PlayerStats WithExpectedValue (Money expectedValue) { ... }</code></pre>
<p>The method implementation is very tedious but the usage gets much cleaner:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var increasedHands = existing.WithHands(existing.Hands + 1);</code></pre>
<p>One way to avoid repetitive code is to generate it.</p>
<h2 id="with-fody-plugin">With.Fody Plugin</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://mikhail.io/2015/12/weaving-your-domain-classes-with-fody/">one of my previous posts</a>
I described how C# value objects can be made less painful with 
<a href="https://github.com/Fody/Fody">Fody</a> - a tool which changes your assembly at
compilation time to provide some desired properties in automated and reliable
fashion.</p>
<p>Please welcome the new Fody plugin <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/With.Fody"><strong>With.Fody</strong></a> 
which auto-implements <code>With</code> method bodies for C# immutable classes.</p>
<p>Here is how to use this plugin for our imaginary example.</p>
<p>First, add a reference to NuGet pakages <code>Fody</code> and <code>With.Fody</code>.</p>
<p>Then, keep the <code>PlayerStats</code> class definition, but get rid of the bodies
of <code>WithXyz</code> methods. Keep the signature but return something trivial like
<code>null</code> or <code>this</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public PlayerStats WithHands(int hands) =&gt; this;
public PlayerStats WithDaysOnline(int daysOnline) =&gt; this;
public PlayerStats WithWon(Money won) =&gt; this;
public PlayerStats WithExpectedValue (Money expectedValue) =&gt; this;</code></pre>
<p>Compile the project and you will see the following line in Build Output:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;      Fody/With:   Added method &#39;With&#39; to type &#39;PlayerStats&#39;.</code></pre><p>It means that the method bodies were re-implemented with calls to 
class constructor with proper parameter values.</p>
<p>The method stubs are needed to satisfy code completion tools like 
IntelliSense and Resharper, otherwise we could skip them altogether.</p>
<h2 id="single-with-for-multiple-properties">Single With() for Multiple Properties</h2>
<p>In case you avoid <a href="https://mikhail.io/2015/08/units-of-measurement-in-domain-design/">Primitive Obsession</a>
antipattern, you will often end up with classes which have unique types of 
properties, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class TripProfile
{
    public TripProfile(
        Distance totalDistance,
        Speed averageSpeed,
        Volume fuelConsumed)
    {
        this.TotalDistance = totalDistance;
        this.AverageSpeed = averageSpeed;
        this.FuelConsumed = fuelConsumed;
    }

    public Distance TotalDistance { get; }
    public Speed AverageSpeed { get; }
    public Volume FuelConsumed { get; }
}</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the plugin can be smart enough to figure out which property
you want to modify just by looking at the type of the argument. The single stub
method can look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public TripProfile With&lt;T&gt;(T value) =&gt; this;</code></pre>
<p>This would get compiled into 3 strongly typed <code>With</code> methods with <code>Distance</code>,
<code>Speed</code> and <code>Volume</code> arguments respectively. Resharper is still happy. And
if you make a mistake and try to call the generic <code>With</code> method with an
argument of wrong type (say <code>int</code>), the compiler will give you an error.</p>
<p>It is safe to call <code>With</code> methods in the same assembly where the class is defined:
the calls get adapted to the real implementation automatically.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-started-with-your-classes">How to Get Started with Your Classes</h2>
<p>Here are the requirements for the classes to be picked up by <strong><code>Fody.With</code></strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a single constructor.</li>
<li>The constructor should have more than one argument.</li>
<li>For each constructor agrument, there must be a gettable property with
same name (case insensitive).</li>
<li>At least one <code>With</code> stub must be defined as described above.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can check out more examples, look at the source code or raise an issue in
<a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/With.Fody">With.Fody github repository</a>.</p>
<p>Give it a try and let me know what your think!</p>
