</ul>
<p>In this post I describe a simple pattern to structure the complex decision making
code using partial function application and fold operation applied to a list of functions.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>Poker decisions are complex and depend on the multitude of parameters and attributes.
We can visualize the decision making process as a Decision Tree where leaf nodes are
decisions being made, and the branches are different conditions. Here is a simplistic
example of such a poker decision tree:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/07/building-a-poker-bot-functional-fold-as-decision-tree-pattern//simple-poker-decision-tree.png" alt="Simplistic Poker Decision Tree"></p>
<p>Now, if we need to implement a similar tree in code, the most straightforward way to
do that is to translate each condition to an <code>if</code> statement. This way, the nested
conditions will guide the application through the branches right to the point where
an appropriate decision can be returned.</p>
<p>This approach works for small cases, but in reality it does not scale particularly 
well in terms of the tree size. Namely, the two problems are:</p>
<p><strong>Tree depth</strong>. In many cases, you might need to pass ten or more conditions before
you find your way to the leaf. Obviously, ten levels of <code>if</code> statements are not
particularly readable and maintainable. We can try to split the sub-trees into
sub-functions, but that only gives a limited relief.</p>
<p><strong>Subtree correlation</strong>. Some tree branches deep down the hiereachy might be correlated
to each other. Say, you pass 10 levels of conditions and make a bet on flop. Now,
on turn, you would probably take quite a different decision path, but the logic
would be based on similar &#39;thinking&#39; in human terms. Ideally, we want to keep this
kind of related decisions together, while isolating them from the other unrelated
decision paths.</p>
<p>In fact, the decision tree should be generalized to the Decision <em>Graph</em> to allow
different decision branches to merge back at some point, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there is one Ace on flop, or an overcard came on turn or river</p>
<p>and stacks pre-flop were 20+ BB, or 12+ BB in limped pot</p>
<p>then bet 75% of the pot</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are multiple paths to the same decisions.</p>
<h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
<p><strong>Break the decision graph down</strong> vertically into smaller chunks. Each chunk should
represent multiple layers of conditions and lead to eventual decisions. All
conditions in sub-graph should be related to each other (high cohesion) and as 
isolated from other sub-graphs as possible (low coupling).</p>
<p>Here are two examples of such sub-graphs:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/07/building-a-poker-bot-functional-fold-as-decision-tree-pattern//decision-subgraphs.png" alt="Isolated Decision Sub-graphs"></p>
<p>Each sub-graph is very focused on very specific paths and ignores all the branches
which do not belong to this decision process. The idea is that those branches
will be handled by other sub-graphs.</p>
<p><strong>Represent each sub-graph as a function</strong> with arbitrary signature which accepts
all the parameters that are required for this sub-graph. Do not accept any parameters
which are not related. </p>
<p>The last parameter of each function should be a 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/01/monads-explained-in-csharp/#maybe">Maybe</a> of Decision,
so should be the function&#39;s return type.</p>
<p><strong>Produce a flat list</strong> of all the sub-graph functions. Partially apply the parameters
to those functions to unify the signature of all of them.</p>
<p>Now, when making a decision, <strong>left-fold the list of functions</strong> with the data of
current poker hand. If a function returns <code>Some</code> value of decision, return it
as the decision produced from the graph.</p>
<h2 id="code-sample">Code sample</h2>
<p>We define a number of functions, each one of which represents one piece of decision 
logic. Then we put them all into the list:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let rules = [
  overtakeLimpedPot overtakyHand snapshot value history;
  increaseTurnBetEQvsAI snapshot;
  allInTurnAfterCheckRaiseInLimpedPot snapshot history;
  checkCallPairedTurnAfterCallWithSecondPairOnFlop snapshot value.Made history;
  bluffyCheckRaiseFlopInLimpedPotFlop bluffyCheckRaiseFlopsLimp snapshot value history;
  bluffyOvertakingRiver bluffyOvertaking snapshot history
]</code></pre>
<p>The type of this list is <code>(Decision option -&gt; Decision option) list</code>.</p>
<p>Note how each individual function accepts different set of parameters. Current hand&#39;s
<code>snapshot</code> is used by all of them, while calculated hand <code>value</code> and previous
action <code>history</code> are used only by some of the functions. </p>
<p>Now, here is the definition of the facade decision making function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">rules |&gt; List.fold (fun opt rule -&gt; rule opt) None</code></pre>
<p>It calculates the decision by folding the list of rules and passing current decision
between them. <code>None</code> is the initial seed of the fold.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Vertical slices are an efficient way to break down the complex decision making
into smaller cohesive manageable parts. Once you get the parts right, it&#39;s easy
to compose them by folding a flat list of partially applied functions into a
<code>Maybe</code> of decision result.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2016/05/dependency-inversion-implies-interfaces-are-owned-by-high-level-modules/'>Dependency Inversion Implies Interfaces Are Owned by High-level Modules</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Dependency Inversion is one of the five principles of widely known and 
acknowledged S.O.L.I.D. design guidelines. This principle is very powerful
and useful when applied consistently. But in my experience, it&#39;s actually
quite easy to misunderstand the idea, or at least to mentally simplify it
to somewhat less profound technique of Dependency Injection.</p>
<p>In this post I will try to give my understanding of the principle, and 
the difference between <em>Inversion</em> and <em>Injection</em>.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start with the Dependency Inversion principle definition. It was given
by Uncle Bob Martin, and consists of two parts.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-abstractions">Part 1: Abstractions</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. 
Both should depend on abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, this is easy to understand. High-level modules are also high-importance
modules, they are about the business domain and are not specific about
technical details. Low-level modules are about wiring those high-level
functions to execution environment, tools and third parties. </p>
<p>Thus, the implementation of high level policy should not depend on 
implementation of low level code, but rather on interfaces (or other
abstractions).</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take a look at an example. Our high-level business domain is about
planning and executing trips from geographical point A to point B. Our
low-level code talks to a service which knows how to calculate the time 
required for a vehicle to go from A to B:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/05/dependency-inversion-implies-interfaces-are-owned-by-high-level-modules//uml-dependency-inversion-violated.png" alt="UML: dependency inversion violated"></p>
<p>So the following code <strong>violates</strong> the first part of the Dependency Inversion:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">namespace Mapping
{
    public class RouteCalculator
    {
        public TimeSpan CalculateDuration(
            double fromLat, double fromLng, double toLat, double toLng)
        {
            // Call a 3rd party web service
        }
    }
}

namespace Planning
{
    public class TripPlanner
    {
        public DateTime ExpectedArrival(Trip trip)
        {
            var calculator = new RouteCalculator();
            var duration = calculator.CalculateDuration(
                trip.Origin.Latitude, 
                trip.Origin.Longitude, 
                trip.Destination.Latitude, 
                trip.Destination.Longitude);
            return trip.Start.Add(duration);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s not compliant to the principle because the high-level code (<code>TripPlanner</code>)
explicitly depends on low-level service (<code>RouteCalculator</code>). Note that I&#39;ve put
them to distinct namespaces to emphasize the required separation.</p>
<p>To improve on that, we might introduce an interface to decouple the 
implementations:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/05/dependency-inversion-implies-interfaces-are-owned-by-high-level-modules//uml-dependency-inversion-with-dependency-injection.png" alt="UML: dependency inversion with dependency injection"></p>
<p>In Trip Planner we accept the interface as constructor parameter, and we&#39;ll get the 
specific implementation at run time:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">namespace Mapping
{
    public class IRouteCalculator
    {
        TimeSpan CalculateDuration(
            double fromLat, double fromLng, double toLat, double toLng);
    }

    public class RouteCalculator : IRouteCalculator
    {
        // Same implementation as before...
    }
}

namespace Planning
{
    public class TripPlanner
    {
        private IRouteCalculator calculator;

        public TripPlanner(IRouteCalculator calculator)
        {
            this.calculator = calculator;
        }

        public DateTime ExpectedArrival(Trip trip)
        {
            var duration = this.calculator.CalculateDuration(
                trip.Origin.Latitude, 
                trip.Origin.Longitude, 
                trip.Destination.Latitude, 
                trip.Destination.Longitude);
            return trip.Start.Add(duration);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This technique is called <em>dependency 
injection</em> or, more specifically, <em>constructor injection</em>. This way 
we can easily substitute the implementation later or inject a test 
double while unit testing.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s just one part of the principle. Let&#39;s move on to part 2.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-details">Part 2: Details</h2>
<p>The second part of the principle says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstractions should not depend upon details. 
Details should depend upon abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find this wording unfortunate because it might be confusing. There are 
some valid examples which explain it with base and derived classes. 
But in our example we solved the part 1 with an interface. So now we are told that
the abstraction (interface) should not depend upon details (implementation).</p>
<p>That probably means that the interface should not leak any entities which
are specific to the given implementation, to make other implementation
equally possible.</p>
<p>While this is try, this second part of the principle may seem to be subordinate
to part one, reducing to an idea &quot;design your interfaces well&quot;. So 
many people tend to leave the part 2 out (
<a href="https://scotch.io/bar-talk/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design#dependency-inversion-principle">example 1</a>,
<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/495019/Dependency-Inversion-Principle-and-the-Dependency">example 2</a>), focusing 
solely on part 1 - the Dependency Injection.</p>
<h2 id="interface-ownership">Interface Ownership</h2>
<p>But Dependency Inversion is <strong>not</strong> just Dependency Injection. So, to revive
the part 2 I would add the following statement to make it clearer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstractions should be owned by higher-level modules and implemented by
lower-level modules.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This rule is violated in our last example. The interface is defined together
with implementation, and is basically just extracted from it. It&#39;s <strong>owned</strong>
by the mapping namespace. </p>
<p>To improve the design, we can transfer the interface ownership to domain
level:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/05/dependency-inversion-implies-interfaces-are-owned-by-high-level-modules//uml-dependency-inversion.png" alt="UML: dependency inversion"></p>
<p>As you can see, I also renamed the interface. The name should reflect the way
how the domain experts would think of this abstraction. Here is the result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">namespace Planning
{
    public class IDurationCalculator
    {
        TimeSpan CalculateDuration(Hub origin, Hub destination);
    }

    public class TripPlanner
    {
        private IDurationCalculator calculator;

        public TripPlanner(IDurationCalculator calculator)
        {
            this.calculator = calculator;
        }

        public DateTime ExpectedArrival(Trip trip)
        {
            var duration = this.calculator.CalculateDuration(
                trip.Origin, trip.Destination);
            return trip.Start.Add(duration);
        }
    }
}

namespace Mapping
{
    public class RouteCalculator : IRouteCalculator
    {
        public TimeSpan CalculateDuration(Hub origin, Hub destination)
        {
            // Extract latitude and longitude from Hubs
            // Call a 3rd party web service
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Now, the interface is defined in <code>Planning</code> namespace, close to its <em>Client</em>,
not its <em>Implementation</em>. That&#39;s the dependency inversion in action. Even
more importantly, it&#39;s defined in terms of our domain - notice the use of
<code>Hub</code> in the interface instead of low-level <code>double</code>.</p>
<h2 id="why-high-level-code-should-own-interfaces">Why High Level Code Should Own Interfaces</h2>
<p>There are multiple benefits to this approach, here are the most important
advantages:</p>
<h3 id="concise-readable-high-level-code">Concise, readable high-level code</h3>
<p>The high-level domain code has the highest value, so the ultimate goal
is to keep it as clean as possible. The interface ownership enables us to
design the most concise interfaces to achieve this goal. We avoid any kind
of adaptation of domain entities to whatever lower-level details.</p>
<h3 id="better-abstractions">Better abstractions</h3>
<p>The interfaces themselves get better as well. They are closer to business,
so abstractions get more ubiquitous and better understood by everyone.</p>
<p>They tend to live longer, just because they are born from the domain side, 
not the infrastructure side.</p>
<h3 id="dependencies-in-outer-layers">Dependencies in outer layers</h3>
<p>Code organization tends to improve too. If an interface is defined in the 
same module as the implementation, the domain module now has
to reference the infrastructure module just to use the interface.</p>
<p>With domain-level interface, the reference goes in the other direction, so
dependencies are pushed up to the outer layers of application. </p>
<p>This principle is the foundation of domain-centric architectures
<a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">Clean architecture</a>,
<a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/Hexagonal+architecture">Ports and Adapters</a> and the likes.</p>
<h3 id="less-cross-domain-dependencies">Less cross-domain dependencies</h3>
<p>In large systems, the business domains should be split into smaller sub-domains, or
bounded contexts. Still, sub-domains are not totally isolated and must 
cooperate to achieve the ultimate business goal. </p>
<p>It might be compelling to reference the interfaces of one sub-domain 
from another sub-domain and then say that the dependency is minimal because
they are hidden behind abstractions.</p>
<p>But coupling with abstractions is still coupling. Instead, each domain should
operate its own abstractions at the high level, and then different abstractions
should be wired together on lower level with techniques like adapters, facades,
context mapping etc.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Here is my working definition of Dependency Inversion principle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. 
Both should depend on abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstractions should not depend upon details. 
Details should depend upon abstractions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstractions should be owned by higher-level modules and implemented by
lower-level modules.</p>
</blockquote>

    <h1><a href='/2016/05/tweaking-immutable-objects-with-csharp-and-fody/'>Tweaking immutable objects with C# and Fody</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Immutable data structures provide a lot of benefits
to programmers, especially when representing domain 
<a href="https://lostechies.com/joeocampo/2007/04/23/a-discussion-on-domain-driven-design-value-objects/">value objects</a>. 
Immutability is an essential part of functional programming paradigm.
The concept is useful in object-oriented languages too, but you have
to pay some price to get this advantage.</p>
<p>In C# immutable classes are usually implemented with read-only
properties which are populated from constructor parameters. One of the 
disadvantages of this approach is the verbosity of creating a copy of an object
with one property value modified.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s have a look at an illustration of this problem. Let&#39;s say we have a value
type representing poker player statistics:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class PlayerStats
{
    public PlayerStats(
        int hands, 
        int daysOnline,
        Money won, 
        Money expectedValue)
    {
        this.Hands = hands;
        this.DaysOnline = daysOnline;
        this.Won = won;
        this.ExpectedValue = expectedValue;
    }

    public int Hands { get; }
    public int DaysOnline { get; }
    public Money Won { get; }
    public Money ExpectedValue { get; }
}</code></pre>
<p>We already see that it&#39;s quite verbose: basically we repeat each property name
five times. But the issue I&#39;m discussing today is related to how we create 
a new object based on another object. Let&#39;s say we need to make a copy of 
a given statistics, but with <code>Hands</code> property increased by 1:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var increasedHands = new PlayerStats(
    existing.Hands + 1,
    existing.DaysOnline,
    existing.Won,
    existing.ExpectedValue);</code></pre>
<p>Not as simple as we could hope. Also, there is some room for mistakes here. For 
instance, we could swap <code>Won</code> and <code>ExpectedValue</code> property calls
and compiler won&#39;t let us know because the types are the same. So we probably
want to use explicit constructor parameter names:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var increasedHands = new PlayerStats(
    hands: existing.Hands + 1,
    daysOnline: existing.DaysOnline,
    won: existing.Won,
    expectedValue: existing.ExpectedValue);</code></pre>
<p>But that leads to even more typing and repetition...</p>
<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>
<p>F# is a functional-first language with immutability as first-class concept.
In F# value objects are usually modelled with Records, here is our example
reimplemented:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type PlayerStats = {
    Hands: int
    DaysOnline: int
    Won: Money
    ExpectedValue: Money
}</code></pre>
<p>Creation of new objects based on other objects is also solved properly in F#,
thanks to the <strong><code>with</code></strong> keyword :</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let increasedHands = { existing with Hands = existing.Hands + 1 }</code></pre>
<p>All the properties are copied from the source record except for the ones
explicitly mentioned in the expression.</p>
<h2 id="defining-with-in-c-">Defining With in C#</h2>
<p>There&#39;s no <strong><code>with</code></strong> operator in C#, but we can try to come up with an
alternative. We can define some fluent methods which would change
property values one by one (they don&#39;t change the original object, but
return a copy with changed value):</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public PlayerStats WithHands(int hands) 
{
    return new PlayerStats(
        hands: hands,
        daysOnline: existing.DaysOnline,
        won: existing.Won,
        expectedValue: existing.ExpectedValue);
}

public PlayerStats WithDaysOnline(int daysOnline) { ... }
public PlayerStats WithWon(Money won) { ... }
public PlayerStats WithExpectedValue (Money expectedValue) { ... }</code></pre>
<p>The method implementation is very tedious but the usage gets much cleaner:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var increasedHands = existing.WithHands(existing.Hands + 1);</code></pre>
<p>One way to avoid repetitive code is to generate it.</p>
<h2 id="with-fody-plugin">With.Fody Plugin</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://mikhail.io/2015/12/weaving-your-domain-classes-with-fody/">one of my previous posts</a>
I described how C# value objects can be made less painful with 
<a href="https://github.com/Fody/Fody">Fody</a> - a tool which changes your assembly at
compilation time to provide some desired properties in automated and reliable
fashion.</p>
<p>Please welcome the new Fody plugin <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/With.Fody"><strong>With.Fody</strong></a> 
which auto-implements <code>With</code> method bodies for C# immutable classes.</p>
<p>Here is how to use this plugin for our imaginary example.</p>
<p>First, add a reference to NuGet pakages <code>Fody</code> and <code>With.Fody</code>.</p>
<p>Then, keep the <code>PlayerStats</code> class definition, but get rid of the bodies
of <code>WithXyz</code> methods. Keep the signature but return something trivial like
<code>null</code> or <code>this</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public PlayerStats WithHands(int hands) =&gt; this;
public PlayerStats WithDaysOnline(int daysOnline) =&gt; this;
public PlayerStats WithWon(Money won) =&gt; this;
public PlayerStats WithExpectedValue (Money expectedValue) =&gt; this;</code></pre>
<p>Compile the project and you will see the following line in Build Output:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;      Fody/With:   Added method &#39;With&#39; to type &#39;PlayerStats&#39;.</code></pre><p>It means that the method bodies were re-implemented with calls to 
class constructor with proper parameter values.</p>
<p>The method stubs are needed to satisfy code completion tools like 
IntelliSense and Resharper, otherwise we could skip them altogether.</p>
<h2 id="single-with-for-multiple-properties">Single With() for Multiple Properties</h2>
<p>In case you avoid <a href="https://mikhail.io/2015/08/units-of-measurement-in-domain-design/">Primitive Obsession</a>
antipattern, you will often end up with classes which have unique types of 
properties, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class TripProfile
{
    public TripProfile(
        Distance totalDistance,
        Speed averageSpeed,
        Volume fuelConsumed)
    {
        this.TotalDistance = totalDistance;
        this.AverageSpeed = averageSpeed;
        this.FuelConsumed = fuelConsumed;
    }

    public Distance TotalDistance { get; }
    public Speed AverageSpeed { get; }
    public Volume FuelConsumed { get; }
}</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the plugin can be smart enough to figure out which property
you want to modify just by looking at the type of the argument. The single stub
method can look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public TripProfile With&lt;T&gt;(T value) =&gt; this;</code></pre>
<p>This would get compiled into 3 strongly typed <code>With</code> methods with <code>Distance</code>,
<code>Speed</code> and <code>Volume</code> arguments respectively. Resharper is still happy. And
if you make a mistake and try to call the generic <code>With</code> method with an
argument of wrong type (say <code>int</code>), the compiler will give you an error.</p>
<p>It is safe to call <code>With</code> methods in the same assembly where the class is defined:
the calls get adapted to the real implementation automatically.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-get-started-with-your-classes">How to Get Started with Your Classes</h2>
<p>Here are the requirements for the classes to be picked up by <strong><code>Fody.With</code></strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a single constructor.</li>
<li>The constructor should have more than one argument.</li>
<li>For each constructor agrument, there must be a gettable property with
same name (case insensitive).</li>
<li>At least one <code>With</code> stub must be defined as described above.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can check out more examples, look at the source code or raise an issue in
<a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/With.Fody">With.Fody github repository</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2016/04/t-sql-merge-statement-is-underrated/'>T-SQL MERGE statement is underrated</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>How many times did you write a SQL to <strong>save</strong> a row without knowing whether the same
primary key already exists or not? You just get an object in your data access layer and
you want to save all fields into the database. </p>
<p>But there is no SAVE statement in SQL, so effectively you need to come up with your 
implementation of &quot;INSERT or UPDATE&quot; command.</p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s take a concrete example. You have a person object with just 3 fields, here is the
type definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class Person
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
}</code></pre>
<p>Persons are entities, so we chose a GUID for the primary key column. We always generate
the unique identifier at client side and just want to save the <code>Person</code>.</p>
<h2 id="typical-solutions">Typical Solutions</h2>
<p>The typical T-SQL developer&#39;s toolbox contains <code>SELECT</code>, <code>INSERT</code>,
<code>UPDATE</code> and <code>DELETE</code> statements. <code>DELETE</code> is of no use here, but the combination of the other
three can be employed to complete the task. The most straightforward option is</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM Person WHERE Id = @Id)
  INSERT Person (Id, Name, Email) VALUES (@Id, @Name, @Email)
ELSE
  UPDATE Person SET Name = @Name AND Email = @Email WHERE Id = @Id</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s 4 lines of code instead of one, but it works. Being more fancy, we can reduce the code to
3 lines of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">UPDATE Person SET Name = @Name AND Email = @Email WHERE Id = @Id
IF @@ROWCOUNT = 0 THEN
  INSERT Person (Id, Name, Email) VALUES (@Id, @Name, @Email)</code></pre>
<p>It should also perform faster if you update more often then insert.</p>
<p>Solved? Not completely...</p>
<p>The problem is that sometimes it doesn&#39;t
work. By default, <code>SELECT</code> doesn&#39;t lock the table, so in race condition scenario there
may be another thread which would insert another row with same Id between the execution of
two statements (or delete the existing row for that matter). Ouch.</p>
<p>If you think that&#39;s just a theoretical problem... Well, it might be for our tiny shiny <code>Person</code>
table, but it will happen for the tables of decent sizes with complex update patterns.</p>
<h2 id="transactions">Transactions</h2>
<p>What do we do when the execution of two statements can cause race conditions with
unpredictable results? We use transactions! So, start a transaction before the statement,
then lock the table in <code>SELECT</code> and commit after all is done. It works, but quite some downsides
again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of boilerplate code</li>
<li>Easy to make a mistake (Which lock do we need? <code>updlock</code>? <code>holdlock</code>? <code>tablockx</code>?)</li>
<li>You might get into a deadlock, so need to handle it gracefully</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="merge">MERGE</h2>
<p>Starting with SQL Server 2008, Microsoft introduced the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/bb510625.aspx">MERGE</a>
statement. Generally, it&#39;s quite powerful and can be used to save all the different rows of a source
table into a target table. But we can also use it for our simple task of saving a person.</p>
<p><code>MERGE</code> is just one statement, so it&#39;s atomic and consistent. It performs very well. 
But the syntax is... oh my god, it&#39;s horrible. Your eyes might bleed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">MERGE Person AS target
USING (SELECT @Id, @Name, @Email) AS source (Id, Name, Email)
   ON (target.Id = source.Id)
 WHEN MATCHED THEN 
      UPDATE SET Name = source.Name, Email = source.Email
 WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
      INSERT (Id, Name, Email) VALUES (source.Id, source.Name, source.Email)</code></pre>
<p>Yes, we repeat the name of each column 6 times. And we say <code>source</code> 7 times. And you can imagine
how the <code>MERGE</code> of a table with 50 columns would look like. And how painful it is to add a new column
to an existing statement written 2 years ago.</p>
<p>By the way, the deadlocks are still possible with <code>MERGE</code> statement, so you need to handle them
properly.</p>
<p>So the developers, even the ones who know about the <code>MERGE</code>, usually choose to use the good old <code>CRUD</code>
combination. But when isn&#39;t the syntax a problem?</p>
<h2 id="generate-it-">Generate It!</h2>
<p>More and more developers shift from writing the stored procedures to using ORMs. With full-blown
ORMs you don&#39;t need to care about particular SQL statements, but you get a bunch of other problems
related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_impedance_mismatch">Object-relational impedance mismatch</a>.</p>
<p>One possible approach is to use a mini-ORM, for instance <a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net">Dapper</a>. 
You do your work in your favourite 
general-purpose language, but stay &quot;close to the metal&quot;, or rather to SQL engine statements.</p>
<p>Here is how I invoke a <code>MERGE</code> statement for a Person object (given a connection from the pool):</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var person = new Person(...);
DapperAdapter.Merge(connection, person);</code></pre>
<p>Voila! The implementation of generic <code>Merge</code> method takes care of the syntax complications.
Write once, use everywhere:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public void Merge&lt;TEntity&gt;(IDbConnection dbConnection, TEntity entity) where TEntity : class
{
    var props = entity.GetType().GetProperties().Select(p =&gt; p.Name).ToList();
    var names = string.Join(&quot;, &quot;, props);
    var values = string.Join(&quot;, &quot;, props.Select(n =&gt; &quot;@&quot; + n));
    var updates = string.Join(&quot;, &quot;, props.Select(n =&gt; $&quot;{n} = @{n}&quot;));
    dbConnection.Execute(
        $@&quot;MERGE {entity.GetType().Name} as target
          USING (VALUES({values}))
          AS SOURCE ({names})
          ON target.Id = @Id
          WHEN matched THEN
            UPDATE SET {updates}
          WHEN not matched THEN
            INSERT({names}) VALUES({values});&quot;,
        entity);
}</code></pre>
<p>Of course, it will only work if you use the convention of naming the <code>Person</code> properties
after the database table. In most cases, there will be a domain class <code>Person</code> and a property
bag class <code>PersonRow</code>, so you&#39;ll have to do the mapping between them. But that might be
easier than writing T-SQL code.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Don&#39;t let the bulky syntax scare you away from the <code>MERGE</code> T-SQL statement. Extend your 
toolbox, and use the tools wisely.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p><em>This is the fourth part of <strong>Building a Poker Bot</strong> series where I describe my experience developing bot software 
to play in online poker rooms. I&#39;m building the bot with .NET framework and F# language which makes the task relatively 
easy and very enjoyable. Here are the previous parts:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-card-recognition/"><em>Building a Poker Bot: Card Recognition</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-string-recognition/"><em>Building a Poker Bot: String and Number Recognition</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/building-a-poker-bot-mouse-movements/"><em>Building a Poker Bot: Mouse Movements</em></a></li>
</ul>
<p>This post lays out the most exciting part of the bot. I&#39;ll compose the recognition, flow, decision and mouse clicking
parts together into the bot application. The application is a console executable interacting with multiple 
windows of poker room software.</p>
<h2 id="flow">Flow</h2>
<p>The following picture shows the outline of the application data flow:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/04/building-a-poker-bot-with-akka-net-actors//pokeractors.png" alt="Actor Diagram"></p>
<p><strong>Find Tables</strong> - Every half a second or so we scan all the windows and search for open poker tables among them.
For each poker table we make a screenshot and send those to recognition.</p>
<p><strong>Recognize Screen</strong> - Parse the data from the screenshot. Check whether it&#39;s our turn to make a play now, what
the <a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-card-recognition/">hole cards</a> and 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-string-recognition/">stacks</a> are, produce the detailed
screen information and send it to decision maker.</p>
<p><strong>Make Decision</strong> - Understand if that&#39;s a new hand or there was a past history before. See
what the villains did and which new cards we got. Here the secret sauce comes to play and produces 
a move to be made. Send the action to the mouse clicker.</p>
<p><strong>Click Buttons</strong> - Based on the decision made, click the right buttons. It should be done with proper delays
and <a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/building-a-poker-bot-mouse-movements/">human-like movements</a> so that the villain
and poker room don&#39;t understand that it&#39;s bot who is playing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="let-the-actors-play">Let the Actors Play</h2>
<p>Because of the multi-tabling, the application is intrinsically multi-threaded. At the same time,
the different parts of the flow are executed at different cadence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding tables is triggered by time and is single-threaded</li>
<li>Screen recognition, history detection and decision making run in sequence and can be executed in parallel
for multiple tables</li>
<li>Clicking the buttons is again single-threaded, as it must synchronize the outputs from the previous steps,
put them in sequence with appropriate delays</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the other treats of the flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is reactive and event based</li>
<li>The flow is unidirectional, the output of one step goes to the input of the next step</li>
<li>Most steps are stateless, but the history state needs to be preserved and, ideally, isolated from the other
steps</li>
</ul>
<p>This list of features made me pick the Actor-based <a href="http://getakka.net">Akka.NET</a> framework to implement the flow.</p>
<p>For sure, the application could be done with a bunch of procedural code instead. 
But I found actors to be a useful modeling technique to be employed. 
It goes well with reactive nature of the application and builds the nice 
foundation for more complicated scenarios in the future.</p>
<p>Also, I was curious how F# and Akka.NET would work together.</p>
<h2 id="supervision-hierachy">Supervision Hierachy</h2>
<p>In Akka.NET each actor has a supervisor actor who is managing its lifecycle. All actors together form a
supervision tree. Here is the tree shown for the Player application:</p>
<p><img src="/2016/04/building-a-poker-bot-with-akka-net-actors//actorhierachy.png" alt="Actor Hierachy"></p>
<p>There is just one copy of both Table Finder and Button Clicker actors and they are supervised by the root
User actor. </p>
<p>For each poker table a Recognizer actor gets created. These actors are managed by Table 
Finder. </p>
<p>Each Recognizer actor creates an instance of Decision actor who keeps the hand history
and makes decisions. </p>
<p>Finally, all decisions are sent to one centralized Button Clicker actor whose job is 
to click all the tables with proper delays and in order.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="implementation-patterns">Implementation Patterns</h2>
<p>All actors are implemented with <a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/">Functional Actor Patterns</a>
which are described in <a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/">my previous post</a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that each actor is defined in functional style with these
building blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type of incoming and, if needed, outgoing messages</li>
<li>A domain function with business logic</li>
<li>Actor function which puts those parts together</li>
<li>Expression to spawn an actor based on actor function</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s look at the examples to understand this structure better.</p>
<h2 id="table-finder">Table Finder</h2>
<p>Table Finder does not have any meaningful input message. It gets a message from
Akka.NET scheduling system just to be periodically activated.</p>
<p>The domain function is called <code>findWindows</code> and has the type <code>unit -&gt; WindowInfo seq</code>.
It returns the poker window screenshots and titles.</p>
<p>Actor function of type <code>int -&gt; seq&lt;string * WindowInfo&gt;</code> is used by the 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/#RouterSupervisor">Router-Supervisor</a> pattern to 
define the behavior. The ouput tuple defines an ID of an output actor and a
message to send to it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let findActor msg = 
  findWindows ()
  |&gt; Seq.map (fun x -&gt; (&quot;recognizer-actor-&quot; + x.TableName, x))</code></pre>
<p>Here is how I spawn the singleton instance of this actor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let tableFinderRef = 
  actorOfRouteToChildren findActor (spawnChild recognizer)
  |&gt; spawn system &quot;table-finder-actor&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>spawnChild</code> is a helper function - essentially an adapter of standard
<code>spawn</code> function with proper parameter order:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let spawnChild childActor name (mailbox : Actor&lt;&#39;a&gt;) = 
  spawn mailbox.Context name childActor</code></pre>
<p>We can also extend it to debug messages when new actors get created.</p>
<h2 id="recognizer">Recognizer</h2>
<p>Recognizer receives the <code>WindowInfo</code> produced by the Table Finder.</p>
<p>The domain function has the type of <code>Bitmap -&gt; Screen</code>. You can read more about table
recognition in <a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-card-recognition/">Part 1</a> and
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/02/building-a-poker-bot-string-recognition/">Part 2</a>
of these series.</p>
<p>Actor function is an implementation of 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/#ConverterSupervisor">Converter-Supervisor</a> pattern. 
The output is a decision message for Decision Maker actor which is a supervised 
child of the Recognizer. Here is the actor function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let recognizeActor (window : WindowInfo) =
  let result = recognize window.Bitmap
  { WindowTitle = window.Title 
    TableName = window.TableName 
    Screen = result 
    Bitmap = window.Bitmap }</code></pre>
<p>And here is the spawn function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let recognizer = actorOfConvertToChild recognizeActor (spawnChild decider &quot;decider&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Notice how this expression was used in Table Finder instantiation above.</p>
<h2 id="decision-maker">Decision Maker</h2>
<p>Decision Maker actor function is an implementation of 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/#StatefulConverter">Stateful Converter</a> pattern. It receives
a decision message from a Recognizer. The output is a click message for a 
singleton Clicker actor. It also needs to preserve some state between two calls.
In the minimalistic implementation this state holds the previous screen that
it received, so that if the same message is received twice, the later message is 
ignored.</p>
<p>This way the actor function has the type of 
<code>DecisionMessage -&gt; Screen option -&gt; ClickerMessage * Screen option</code> 
and looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let decisionActor msg lastScreen =
  let screen = msg.Screen
  match lastScreen with
  | Some s when s = screen -&gt; (None, lastScreen)
  | _ -&gt;
    let action = decide screen
    let outMsg = { WindowTitle = msg.WindowTitle; Clicks = action }
    (Some outMsg, Some screen) </code></pre>
<p>Here is the spawn function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let decider = actorOfStatefulConvert decisionActor None clickerRef</code></pre>
<p>where <code>None</code> represents the initial state.</p>
<h2 id="button-clicker">Button Clicker</h2>
<p>Clicker actor has the simplest implementation because it does not send messages to other actors.
Here is the message that it receives from Decision Maker:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type ClickTarget = (int * int * int * int)
type ClickerMessage = {
  WindowTitle: string
  Clicks: ClickTarget[]
}</code></pre>
<p>The domain function has the simple type <code>ClickerMessage -&gt; unit</code> with mouse
clicks as side effect. You can read more about the mouse movements in 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/building-a-poker-bot-mouse-movements/">Part 3</a>
of these series.</p>
<p><a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/03/functional-actor-patterns-with-akkadotnet-and-fsharp/#MessageSink">Message Sink</a>
pattern is used for this actor, so actor function isn&#39;t
really needed. We spawn the singleton instance with the following statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let clickerRef = actorOfSink click |&gt; spawn system &quot;clicker-actor&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Actor goes under supervision by actor system with <code>click</code> as message handler.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The top layer of poker player application is composed of small single-purpose
actors which talk to each other by sending messages. </p>
<p>Thanks to succinct F# language and functional actor patterns this layer is
very thin, and thus easy to understand and maintain. </p>
<p>The business logic is isolated and by itself has no dependency on Akka.NET.</p>
