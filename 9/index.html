    <h1><a href='/2014/05/21/sgen-to-precompile-classes-for-xmpserializer'>Sgen to precompile classes for XmlSerializer</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>During my investigation of our ASP.NET application performance issue, I&#39;ve found out that XmlSerializer may require a long warm-up. The first time, when it&#39;s used for a specific class (de-)serialization, can take up to 500 ms om my machine! We use XmlSerializer to encode/decode user preferences. Having 40 different classes being deserialized at user login lead to a massive delay of 14 seconds. This is only for the first user login after the application start-up, but you do quite a lot of &#39;first times&#39; every day while developing the application.</p>
<p>These delays are caused by the runtime which prepares and compiles the strongly typed classes for serialization in runtime. Not sure why it&#39;s SO slow, but probably things might go wrong.</p>
<p>There is a simple solution for this problem: create those helper classes at build time, pack it into an assembly and ship it as part of your .NET application. The tool that does this is called Sgen.exe, and it is a part of .NET SDK. So, we just need to use it in our project.</p>
<p>The easiest way is to add a post-build event in your CS project properties. The event would look like</p>
<p>sgen.exe /force /assembly:&quot;$(TargetPath)&quot;
After re-compiling the project, you should see a new assembly in Bin directory, which has the name ending with XmlSerializers.dll. That&#39;s the new assembly which will save you several seconds on each application start-up. It will be automatically copied to Bin directory of the projects which reference the original assembly with your serializable classes, so no other actions needed.</p>
<p>However, this command might fail. Sgen tool will try to prepare the helper classes for each class in your assembly, which might not be possible. Then you&#39;ll get some error messages in Visual Studio. In this case, you might want to add a &quot;/types&quot; parameter, explicitly listing the class names to precompile. But I have a better solution for you.</p>
<p>It&#39;s quite possible that you use MSBuild for regular automated builds of your project. We do. In this case a post-build event in the project properties won&#39;t work during those build. Then, do not add any post-build events, but instead open your .csproj file in plain text editor, and search for the following commented section:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs xml"><span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- To modify your build process, add your task inside one of the targets below and uncomment it. 
   Other similar extension points exist, see Microsoft.Common.targets.
&lt;Target Name="BeforeBuild"&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;
&lt;Target Name="AfterBuild"&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;
--&gt;</span>
</code></pre><p>Uncomment the second XML node and substitute it with something like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs nix">&lt;Target <span class="hljs-variable">Name=</span><span class="hljs-string">"AfterBuild"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">DependsOnTargets=</span><span class="hljs-string">"AssignTargetPaths;Compile;ResolveKeySource"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">Inputs=</span><span class="hljs-string">"$(MSBuildAllProjects);@(IntermediateAssembly)"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">Outputs=</span><span class="hljs-string">"$(OutputPath)$(_SGenDllName)"</span>&gt;
    &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
      &lt;SgenTypes <span class="hljs-variable">Include=</span><span class="hljs-string">"MyNamespace.MySerializableClass1"</span> /&gt;
      &lt;SgenTypes <span class="hljs-variable">Include=</span><span class="hljs-string">"MyNamespace.MySerializableClass2"</span> /&gt;
      &lt;SgenTypes <span class="hljs-variable">Include=</span><span class="hljs-string">"MyNamespace.MySerializableClassN"</span> /&gt;
    &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
    &lt;Delete <span class="hljs-variable">Files=</span><span class="hljs-string">"$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).XmlSerializers.dll"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">ContinueOnError=</span><span class="hljs-string">"true"</span> /&gt;
    &lt;SGen <span class="hljs-variable">BuildAssemblyName=</span><span class="hljs-string">"$(TargetFileName)"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">BuildAssemblyPath=</span><span class="hljs-string">"$(OutputPath)"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">References=</span><span class="hljs-string">"@(ReferencePath)"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">ShouldGenerateSerializer=</span><span class="hljs-string">"true"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">UseProxyTypes=</span><span class="hljs-string">"false"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">KeyContainer=</span><span class="hljs-string">"$(KeyContainerName)"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">KeyFile=</span><span class="hljs-string">"$(KeyOriginatorFile)"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">DelaySign=</span><span class="hljs-string">"$(DelaySign)"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">ToolPath=</span><span class="hljs-string">"$(SGenToolPath)"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">Types=</span><span class="hljs-string">"@(SgenTypes)"</span>&gt;
      &lt;Output <span class="hljs-variable">TaskParameter=</span><span class="hljs-string">"SerializationAssembly"</span> <span class="hljs-variable">ItemName=</span><span class="hljs-string">"SerializationAssembly"</span> /&gt;
    &lt;/SGen&gt;
&lt;/Target&gt;
</code></pre><p>The ItemGroup lists all the classes that you need to precompile. You can omit this section and Types attribute of SGen node if you want to compile all classes in assembly.
Have a nice application start-up boost!</p>

<p>Poker Money is a basic tool for tracking online poker results, which supports all game types for the two major poker rooms: PokerStars and FullTiltPoker.</p>
<p>Here is a sample screen:

    <h1><a href='/2012/12/26/one-certificate-missing-one-received-unexpectedly'>One certificate missing, one received unexpectedly</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Today I want to give a note about two more online courses that I completed.</p>
<p>The last one (10 weeks in September-November) was called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compfinance">Introduction to Computational Finance and Financial Econometrics</a> and was lead by Eric Zivot from University of Washington. First of all, it was the most intense course out of all that I took to date. Every of 10 weeks we had about 3-4 hours of videos + homework. The course material was mostly about maths and statistics, and less about application in economics. However, some concepts were new to me and sounded very interesting.</p>
<p>I scored about 95% on all tests and exams (they were relatively easy comparing to video material). But unfortunately, I got no certificate or even course record for this! It seems that University of Washington did not allow Coursera to issue such certificates and records... What a shame! I spent lots of time on it, and a record would be satisfactory. Please be careful if you take this course or other courses of UoW in the future.</p>
<p>However, I got another unexpected certificate. In June, I took a course called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/hci">Human-Computer Interaction</a> about user interface design concepts and approaches. I started it with a big delay because of my vacation, so I thought I wouldn&#39;t score enough for a certificate. But I was wrong! I got the certificate 6 months after the course ended:
<img src="/2012/12/26/one-certificate-missing-one-received-unexpectedly/hci.jpg" alt="HCI certificate"></p>
<p>The course was short but useful. I wish there would be an extension course, which would cover more details on the topic.</p>

        <p>I&#39;ve recently received a statement of accomplishment document for <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" title="Coursera">Coursera</a>&#39;s online <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/introfinance" title="Introduction to Finance class">Introduction to Finance class</a> that I took in July-September this year.</p>
<p><img src="/2012/11/01/finance-class-at-coursera/finance.jpg" alt="Finance"></p>
<p>The course was lead by prof. Gautam Kaul from University of Michigan. The level of lectures was really introductory, the pace was very slow (too slow for me, even watching x1.5 speed). You could learn about basic finance principles like time value of money, calculating cash flows and discounted values, about stocks and bonds, and risk/return relations.</p>
<p>I liked a lot the assignment tests, which were much stronger and solid then the examples in lectures. They were challenging most of the time, so I&#39;m glad I managed to get 100% score in the end :)</p>
<p>Recommended for anyone who has no idea about what finance is about, but not for experienced students.</p>

<p>The course was lead by prof. Kevin Werbach from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. He told us about applying game techniques to non-game world problems: business, social etc. In essence, it&#39;s on how to add FUN to processes, that are not supposed to be fun at all. Which is really cool. I loved both informative and well-producted lectures, and peer-reviewed assignments that appeared to be... fun :)</p>
<p>Want to know why Stackoverflow and Foursquare are such a success? Come join this course next time!</p>
<p>I hope I&#39;ll have a chance to apply the ideas from the course in real life!</p>
