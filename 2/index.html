    <h1><a href='/2017/06/finding-lost-events-in-azure-application-insights/'>Finding Lost Events in Azure Application Insights</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>One of the ways we use Azure Application Insights is tracking custom
application-specific events. For instance, every time a data point from an
IoT device comes in, we log an AppInsights event. Then we are able to
aggregate the data and plot charts to derive trends and detect possible 
anomalies.</p>
<p>And recently we found such anomaly, which looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="/2017/06/finding-lost-events-in-azure-application-insights//dashboard-chart.png" alt="Amount of Events on Dashboard Chart"></p>
<p>This is a chart from our Azure dashboard, which shows the total amount of
events of specific type received per day. </p>
<p>The first two &quot;hills&quot; are two weeks, so we can clearly see that we get more
events on business days compared to weekends.</p>
<p>But then something happened on May 20: we started getting much less events,
and the hill pattern disappeared, days looks much more alike.</p>
<p>We haven&#39;t noticed any other problems in the system, but the trend looked
quite bothering. Are we loosing data?</p>
<p>I headed towards Analytics console of Application Insights to dig deeper.
Here is the query that reproduces the problem:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs stylus">customEvents
| where name == <span class="hljs-string">"EventXReceived"</span>
| where timestamp &gt;= <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">ago</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-number">22</span>d)</span></span>
| project PointCount = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">todouble</span><span class="hljs-params">(customMeasurements[<span class="hljs-string">"EventXReceived_Count"</span>])</span></span>, timestamp
| summarize EventXReceived = <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">sum</span><span class="hljs-params">(PointCount)</span></span> by <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">bin</span><span class="hljs-params">(timestamp, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>d)</span></span>
| render timechart
</code></pre><p>and I got the same chart as before:</p>
<p><img src="/2017/06/finding-lost-events-in-azure-application-insights//analytics1.png" alt="Trend on Application Insights Analytics"></p>
<p>I checked the history of our source code repository and deployments and I
figured out that we upgraded the version of Application Insights SDK from 
version 2.1 to version 2.3.</p>
<p>My guess at this point was that Application Insights started sampling our
data instead of sending all events to the server. After reading 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-insights/app-insights-sampling">Sampling in Application Insights</a>
article, I came up with the following query to see the sampling rate:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs stylus">customEvents
| where name == <span class="hljs-string">"EventXReceived"</span>
| where timestamp &gt;= <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">ago</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-number">22</span>d)</span></span>
| summarize <span class="hljs-number">100</span>/<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">avg</span><span class="hljs-params">(itemCount)</span></span> by <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">bin</span><span class="hljs-params">(timestamp, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>d)</span></span> 
| render areachart
</code></pre><p>and the result is self-explanatory:</p>
<p><img src="/2017/06/finding-lost-events-in-azure-application-insights//sampling-rate.png" alt="Sampling Rate"></p>
<p>Clearly, the sampling rate dropped from 100% down to about 30% right when
the anomaly started. The sampling-adjusted query (note <code>itemCount</code> multiplication)</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs 1c">customEvents
<span class="hljs-string">| where name == "</span>EventXReceived<span class="hljs-string">"</span>
<span class="hljs-string">| where timestamp &gt;= ago(22d)</span>
<span class="hljs-string">| project PointCount = todouble(customMeasurements["</span>EventXReceived_Count<span class="hljs-string">"]) * itemCount, timestamp</span>
<span class="hljs-string">| summarize EventXReceived = sum(PointCount) by bin(timestamp, 1d)</span>
<span class="hljs-string">| render timechart</span>
</code></pre><p>puts us back to the point when results make sense:</p>
<p><img src="/2017/06/finding-lost-events-in-azure-application-insights//analytics2.png" alt="Adjusted Trend on Application Insights Analytics"></p>
<p>The third week&#39;s Thursday was bank holiday in several European countries, so 
we got a drop there.</p>
<p>Should Azure dashboard items take sampling into account - to avoid
confusing people and to show more useful charts?</p>

<p>While there&#39;s not that much to secure on my blog, HTTPS is still considered
to be a good practice for any site in 2017. One of the benefits that we can
get from it is the usage of HTTP/2 protocol:</p>

    <h1><a href='/2017/05/reliable-consumer-of-azure-event-hubs/'>Reliable Consumer of Azure Event Hubs</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/event-hubs/">Azure Event Hubs</a> is
a log-based messaging system-as-a-service in Azure cloud. It&#39;s designed to be able to handle huge
amount of data, and naturally supports multiple consumers.</p>
<h2 id="event-hubs-and-service-bus">Event Hubs and Service Bus</h2>
<p>While Event Hubs are formally part of Azure Service Bus family of products,
in fact its model is quite different.</p>
<p>&quot;Traditional&quot; Service Bus service is organized around queues (subscriptions
are just queues with the topic being the source of messages). Each consumer 
can peek messages from the queue, do the required processing and then
complete the message to remove it from the queue, or abort the processing.
Abortion will leave the message at the queue, or will move it to the Dead Letter
Queue. Completion/abortion are granular per message; and the status of each
message is managed by the Service Bus broker.</p>
<p><img src="/2017/05/reliable-consumer-of-azure-event-hubs//service-bus-processors.png" alt="Service Bus Processors"></p>
<p>Event Hubs service is different. Each Hub represnts a log of messages.
Event producer appends data to the end of the log, and consumers can read this log,
but they can&#39;t remove or change the status of events there.</p>
<p>Each event has an offset associated with it. And the only operation that is
supported for consumers is &quot;give me some messages starting at the offset X&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="/2017/05/reliable-consumer-of-azure-event-hubs//event-hub-processors.png" alt="Event Hub Processors"></p>
<p>While this approach might seem simplistic, it actually  makes consumers 
more powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The messages do not disappear from the Hub after being processed for the
first time. So, if needed, the consumer can go back and re-process older
events again;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Multiple consumers are always supported, out of the box. They just read
the same log, after all;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each consumer can go at its own pace, drop and resume processing whenever
needed, with no effect on other consumers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some disadvantages too:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Consumers have to manage their own state of the processing progress, i.e.
they have to save the offset of the last processed event;</p>
</li>
<li><p>There is no way to mark any specific event as failed to be able to reprocess
it later. There&#39;s no notion of Dead Letter Queue either.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="event-processor-host">Event Processor Host</h2>
<p>To overcome the first complication, Microsoft provides the consumer API called
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/event-hubs/event-hubs-programming-guide.md">EventProcessorHost</a>.
This API has an implementation of consumers based on checkpointing. All you
need to do is to provide a callback to process a batch of events, and then call
<code>CheckpointAsync</code> method, which saves the current offset of the last message
into Azure Blob Storage. If the consumer restarts at any point in time, it will
read the last checkpoint to find the current offset, and will then continue
processing from that point on.</p>
<p>It works great for some scenarios, but the event delivery/processing guarantees
are relatively low in this case:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Any failures are ignored: there&#39;s no retry or Dead Letter Queue</p>
</li>
<li><p>There are no transactions between event hub checkpoints and the data sinks
that the processor works with (i.e. data stores where processed messages 
end up at)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post I want to focus on a way to process events with higher consistency
requirements, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Event Hub processor modifies data in a SQL Database, and such 
processing is transactional per batch of messages</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each event should be (successfully) processed exactly once</p>
</li>
<li><p>If event processing failed, it should be marked as failed and kept 
available to be reprocessed at later point in time</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While end-to-end exactly-once processing would require changes of the 
producers too, we will only focus on consumer side in this post.</p>
<h2 id="transactional-checkpoints-in-sql">Transactional Checkpoints in SQL</h2>
<p>If checkpoint information is stored in Azure Blobs, there is no obvious way to
implement distributed transactions between SQL Database and Azure Storage.</p>
<p>However, we can override the default checkpointing mechanism and 
implement our own checkpoints based on a SQL table. This way each 
checkpoint update can become part of a SQL transaction and be committed
or rolled back with normal guarantees provided by SQL Server.</p>
<p>Here is a table that I created to hold my checkpoints:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs sql"><span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">CREATE</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">TABLE</span> EventHubCheckpoint (
  Topic <span class="hljs-built_in">varchar</span>(<span class="hljs-number">100</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>,
  PartitionID <span class="hljs-built_in">varchar</span>(<span class="hljs-number">100</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>,
  SequenceNumber <span class="hljs-built_in">bigint</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>,
  Offset <span class="hljs-built_in">varchar</span>(<span class="hljs-number">20</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>,
  <span class="hljs-keyword">CONSTRAINT</span> PK_EventHubCheckpoint <span class="hljs-keyword">PRIMARY</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">KEY</span> CLUSTERED (Topic, PartitionID)
)
</span></code></pre>
<p>For each topic and partition of Event Hubs, we store two values: sequence
number and offset, which together uniquely identify the consumer position.</p>
<p>Conveniently, Event Host Processor provides an extensibility point to
override the default checkpoint manager with a custom one. For that we
need to implement <code>ICheckpointManager</code> interface to work with our SQL
table.</p>
<p>The implementation mainly consists of 3 methods: <code>CreateCheckpointIfNotExistsAsync</code>,
<code>GetCheckpointAsync</code> and <code>UpdateCheckpointAsync</code>. The names are pretty
much self-explanatory, and my Dapper-based implementation is quite trivial.
You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/mikhailio-samples/blob/master/eventhubs-sqlcheckpoints/SQLCheckpointManager.cs">here</a>.</p>
<p>For now, I&#39;m ignoring the related topic of lease management and corresponding
interface <code>ILeaseManager</code>. It&#39;s quite a subject on its own; for the sake
of simplicity I&#39;ll assume we have just one consumer process per partition,
which makes proper lease manager redundand.</p>
<h2 id="dead-letter-queue">Dead Letter Queue</h2>
<p>Now, we want to be able to mark some messages as failed and to 
re-process them later. To make Dead Letters transactional, we need another
SQL table to hold the failed events:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs sql"><span class="hljs-operator"><span class="hljs-keyword">CREATE</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">TABLE</span> EventHubDeadLetter (
  Topic <span class="hljs-built_in">varchar</span>(<span class="hljs-number">100</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>,
  PartitionID <span class="hljs-built_in">varchar</span>(<span class="hljs-number">100</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>,
  SequenceNumber <span class="hljs-built_in">bigint</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>,
  Offset <span class="hljs-built_in">varchar</span>(<span class="hljs-number">20</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>,
  FailedAt datetime <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>,
  Error <span class="hljs-keyword">nvarchar</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">max</span>) <span class="hljs-keyword">NOT</span> <span class="hljs-literal">NULL</span>,
  <span class="hljs-keyword">CONSTRAINT</span> PK_EventHubDeadLetter <span class="hljs-keyword">PRIMARY</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">KEY</span> CLUSTERED (Topic, PartitionID)
)
</span></code></pre>
<p>This table looks very similar to <code>EventHubCheckpoint</code> that I
defined above. That is because they are effectively storing pointers to
events in a hub. Dead Letters have two additional columns to store error
timestamp and text.</p>
<p>There is no need to store the message content, because failed events still
sit in the event hub anyway. You could still log it for diagnostics purpose - just make an extra
<code>varbinary</code> column.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no notion of dead letters in Event Hubs SDK, so I defined my own
interface <code>IDeadLetterManager</code> with a single <code>AddFailedEvents</code> method:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs undefined">public interface IDeadLetterManager
{
    Task AddFailedEvents(IEnumerable&lt;DeadLetter&lt;EventData&gt;&gt; deadLetters);
}

public class DeadLetter&lt;T&gt;
{
    public T Data { get; set; }
    public DateTime FailureTime { get; set; }
    public Exception Exception { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Dapper-based implementation is trivial again, you can find the code 
<a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/mikhailio-samples/blob/master/eventhubs-sqlcheckpoints/SQLDeadLetterManager.cs">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-together-event-host">Putting It Together: Event Host</h2>
<p>My final solution is still using <code>EventHostProcessor</code>. I pass <code>SQLCheckpointManager</code> 
into its constructor, and then I implement <code>IEventProcessor</code>&#39;s 
<code>ProcessEventsAsync</code> method in the following way:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instantiate a list of items to store failed events</li>
<li>Start a SQL transaction</li>
<li>Loop through all the received events in the batch</li>
<li>Process each item inside a try-catch block</li>
<li>If exception happens, add the current event to the list of failed events</li>
<li>After all items are processed, save failed events to Dead Letter table</li>
<li>Update the checkpoint pointer</li>
<li>Commit the transaction</li>
</ol>
<p>The code block that illustrates this workflow:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs cs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">async</span> Task <span class="hljs-title">ProcessEventsAsync</span><span class="hljs-params">(

        }

        <span class="hljs-comment">// 8. Commit the transaction</span>
        scope.Complete();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>My implementation of Event Hubs consumer consists of 3 parts: checkpoint 
manager that saves processing progress per partition into a SQL table;
dead letter manager that persists information about processing errors;
and an event host which uses both to provide transactional processing
of events.</p>
<p>The transaction scope is limited to SQL Server databases, but it might be
sufficient for many real world scenarios.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>So you are a C# developer. And you need to read the code and understand its
structure. Maybe you&#39;ve just joined the project, or it&#39;s your own code you
wrote 1 year ago. In any case, reading code is hard.</p>
<p>Luckily, some good thought was applied to this particular piece of code.
It&#39;s all broken down into small classes (they might even be SOLID!), and all 
the dependencies are injected via constructors. It looks like it&#39;s your
code indeed.</p>
<p>So, you figured out that the entry point for your current use case is the
class called <code>ThingService</code>. It&#39;s probably doing something with <code>Thing</code>&#39;s
and that&#39;s what you need. The signature of the class constructor looks 
like this:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs cs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title">ThingService</span><span class="hljs-params">(
    IGetThings readRepository,
    ISaveThing saveRepository,
    IParseAndValidateExcel&lt;Thing, <span class="hljs-keyword">string</span>&gt; fileParser,
    IThingChangeDetector thingChangeDetector,
    IMap&lt;Thing, ThingDTO&gt; thingToDtoMapper,
    IMap&lt;<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span>, ThingDTO, Thing&gt; dtoToThingMapper)</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>OK, so we clearly have 6 dependencies here, and they are all interfaces.
We don&#39;t know where those interfaces are implemented, but hey - we&#39;ve got
the best tooling in the industry, so right click on <code>IGetThings</code>, then 
<code>Go To Implementation</code>.</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs cs"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-title">DapperThingRepository</span><span class="hljs-params">(
    ICRUDAdapter adapter,
    IDatabaseConnectionFactory connectionFactory,
    IMap&lt;Thing, ThingRow&gt; thingRowMapper,
    IMap&lt;ThingRow, Thing&gt; thingMapper)</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we know that we get <code>Thing</code> from Dapper, so probably from a SQL database.
Let&#39;s go one level deeper and check where those Mappers are implemented.
Right click, <code>Go To Implementation</code>... But instead of navigating to another code
file you see</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs mathematica"><span class="hljs-keyword">Find</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">Symbol</span> Result - <span class="hljs-number">28</span> matches found
</code></pre><p>Oh, right, looks like we use <code>IMap&lt;T, U&gt;</code> in more places. OK, we&#39;ll find the
right one later, let&#39;s first check the connection factory... 
Right click, <code>Go To Implementation</code>. Nah:</p>
<pre class="highlight"><code class="hljs nginx"><span class="hljs-title">The</span> symbol has <span class="hljs-built_in">no</span> implementation
</code></pre><p>What? But the application works! Ah, <code>IDatabaseConnectionFactory</code> comes
from an internal library, so most probably the implementation is also 
inside that library.</p>
<p>Clearly, navigation doesn&#39;t go that well so far.</p>
<h2 id="dependency-graph">Dependency Graph</h2>
<p>When code reading gets tricky, usually an image can boost the understanding.
The picture below actually shows the graph of class dependencies from our
example:</p>
<p><img src="/2017/03/visualizing-dependency-tree-from-di-container//class-dependency-graph.png" alt="Class Dependency Graph"></p>
<p>Each node is a class, each arrow is a dependency - an interface injected
into the constructor. </p>
<p>Just by looking at the picture for a minute of two you can start seeing some 
structure, and get at least the high-level opinion about the application
complexity and class relationships.</p>
<p>Picture is also a great way of communication. Once you understand the structure,
you can explain it to a colleague much easier with boxes and lines
on the screen in addition to a plain wall of code.</p>
<p>You can enrich such picture with comments at the time of writing and leave 
it to your future self or anyone who would read the code in 2 years time.</p>
<p>But now the question is - what&#39;s the easiest way to draw such dependency graph?</p>
<h2 id="di-container">DI Container</h2>
<p>The assumption of this post is that a dependency injection (DI) container
of some kind is used in the project. If so, chances are that you can get such
dependency graph from the container registrations.</p>
<p>My example is based on <a href="https://simpleinjector.org/">Simple Injector</a> DI 
container which is used by ourselves. So, further on I will explain how to
draw a dependency graph from Simple Injector container.</p>
<p>My guess is that any mature DI library will provide you with such possibility,
mostly because the dependency graphs are built internally by any container 
during its normal operations.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>The implementation idea of dependency graph visualization is quite simple, as
the biggest chunk of work is done by Simple Injector itself. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Run all your DI registrations as you do in the actual application. This will
initialize Container to the desired state.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Define which class should be the root of the dependency tree under study. 
You can refine later, but you need to start somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Call <code>GetRegistration</code> method of DI container for the selected type. An instance
of <code>InstanceProducer</code> type is returned.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Call <code>GetRelationships</code> method of the instance producer to retrieve all 
interface/class pairs that the given type depends on. Save each relation into
your output list.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Navigate through each dependency recursively to load further layers of the graph.
Basically, do the depth-first search and save all found relations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Convert the list of found relations into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz">GraphViz</a>
textual graph description.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use a tool like <a href="http://www.webgraphviz.com/">WebGraphviz</a> do the actual
visualization by converting text to picture.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several potential pitfalls on the way, like cyclic graphs, decorator
registrations etc. To help you avoid those I&#39;ve created a small library to automate 
steps 3 to 6 from the list above. See my 
<a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/SimpleInjector.Visualization">SimpleInjector.Visualization github repo</a> 
and let me know if you find it useful.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>People are good at making sense of visual representations - use that skill to
improve understanding and communication within your development team.</p>
<p>Dependency injection practice requires a lot of ceremony to set it up and
running. Leverage this work for the best: check what kind of insights you
can get from that setup. Dependency graph visualization is one example of 
such leverage, but there might be other gems in there. </p>
<p>Just keep searching!</p>
