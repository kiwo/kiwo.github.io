    <h1><a href='/2018/07/getting-started-with-aws-lambda-in-pulumi/'>Getting Started with AWS Lambda in Pulumi</a></h1>
    

    

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>For a small research project of mine, I needed to create HTTP triggered
AWS Lambda&#39;s in all supported programming languages.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a power AWS user, so I get easily confused about the configuration
of things like IAM roles or API Gateway. Moreover, I wanted my environment to
be reproducible, so manual AWS Console wasn&#39;t a good option.</p>
<p>I decided it was a good job for Pulumi. They pay a lot of attention to
serverless and especially AWS Lambda, and I love the power of 
configuration as code.</p>
<p>I created a Pulumi program which provisions Lambda&#39;s running on Javascript,
.NET, Python, Java and Go. Pulumi program itself is written in Javascript.</p>
<p>I&#39;m describing the resulting code below in case folks need to do the same thing.
The code itself is on <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/pulumi-aws-serverless-examples">my github</a>.</p>
<h2 id="javascript">Javascript</h2>
<p>Probably, the vast majority of Pulumi + AWS Lambda users will be using
Javascript as programming language for their serverless functions.</p>
<p>No wonder that this scenario is the easiest to start with. There is a
high-level package <code>@pulumi/cloud-aws</code> which hides all the AWS machinery from
a developer. </p>
<p>The simplest function will consist of just several lines:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const cloud = require(&quot;@pulumi/cloud-aws&quot;);

const api = new cloud.API(&quot;aws-hellolambda-js&quot;);
api.get(&quot;/js&quot;, (req, res) =&gt; {
    res.status(200).json(&quot;Hi from Javascript lambda&quot;);
});

exports.endpointJs = api.publish().url;</code></pre>
<p>Configure your Pulumi stack, run <code>pulumi update</code> and a Lambda 
is up, running and accessible via HTTP.</p>
<h2 id="-net-core">.NET Core</h2>
<p>.NET is my default development environment and AWS Lambda supports .NET Core
as execution runtime.</p>
<p>Pulumi program is still Javascript, so it can&#39;t mix C# code in. Thus, the setup
looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a .NET Core 2.0 application written in C# and utilizing
<code>Amazon.Lambda.*</code> NuGet packages</li>
<li>I build and publish this application with <code>dotnet</code> CLI</li>
<li>Pulumi then utilizes the published binaries to create deployment artifacts</li>
</ul>
<p>C# function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class Functions
{
    public async Task&lt;APIGatewayProxyResponse&gt; GetAsync(APIGatewayProxyRequest request, ILambdaContext context)
    {
        return new APIGatewayProxyResponse
        {
            StatusCode = (int)HttpStatusCode.OK,
            Body = &quot;\&quot;Hi from C# Lambda\&quot;&quot;,
            Headers = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt; { { &quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;application/json&quot; } }
        };
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>For non-Javascript lambdas I utilize <code>@pulumi/aws</code> package. It&#39;s of lower level
than <code>@pulumi/cloud-aws</code>, so I had to setup IAM first:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const aws = require(&quot;@pulumi/aws&quot;);

const policy = {
    &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,
    &quot;Statement&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;sts:AssumeRole&quot;,
            &quot;Principal&quot;: {
                &quot;Service&quot;: &quot;lambda.amazonaws.com&quot;,
            },
            &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,
            &quot;Sid&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
        },
    ],
};
const role = new aws.iam.Role(&quot;precompiled-lambda-role&quot;, {
    assumeRolePolicy: JSON.stringify(policy),
});</code></pre>
<p>And then I did a raw definition of AWS Lambda:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const pulumi = require(&quot;@pulumi/pulumi&quot;);

const csharpLambda = new aws.lambda.Function(&quot;aws-hellolambda-csharp&quot;, {
    runtime: aws.lambda.DotnetCore2d0Runtime,
    code: new pulumi.asset.AssetArchive({
        &quot;.&quot;: new pulumi.asset.FileArchive(&quot;./csharp/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/publish&quot;),
    }),
    timeout: 5,
    handler: &quot;app::app.Functions::GetAsync&quot;,
    role: role.arn
});</code></pre>
<p>Note the path to <code>publish</code> folder, which should match the path created by
<code>dotnet publish</code>, and the handler name matching C# class/method.</p>
<p>Finally, I used <code>@pulumi/aws-serverless</code> to define API Gateway endpoint for
the lambda:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const serverless = require(&quot;@pulumi/aws-serverless&quot;);

const precompiledApi = new serverless.apigateway.API(&quot;aws-hellolambda-precompiledapi&quot;, {
    routes: [
        { method: &quot;GET&quot;, path: &quot;/csharp&quot;, handler: csharpLambda },
    ],
});</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s definitely more ceremony compared to Javascript version. But hey, it&#39;s
code, so if you find yourself repeating the same code, go ahead and make a
higher order component out of it, incapsulating the repetitive logic.</p>
<h2 id="python">Python</h2>
<p>Pulumi supports Python as scripting language, but I&#39;m sticking to Javascript
for uniform experience.</p>
<p>In this case, the flow is similar to .NET but simpler: no compilation step
is required. Just define a <code>handler.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def handler(event, context): 
    return {
        &#39;statusCode&#39;: 200,
        &#39;headers&#39;: {&#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;},
        &#39;body&#39;: &#39;&quot;Hi from Python lambda&quot;&#39;
    }</code></pre>
<p>and package it into zip in AWS lambda definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const pythonLambda = new aws.lambda.Function(&quot;aws-hellolambda-python&quot;, {
    runtime: aws.lambda.Python3d6Runtime,
    code: new pulumi.asset.AssetArchive({
        &quot;.&quot;: new pulumi.asset.FileArchive(&quot;./python&quot;),
    }),
    timeout: 5,
    handler: &quot;handler.handler&quot;,
    role: role.arn
});</code></pre>
<p>I&#39;m reusing the <code>role</code> definition from above. The API definition will also
be the same as for .NET.</p>
<h2 id="go">Go</h2>
<p>Golang is a compiled language, so the approach is similar to .NET: write code,
build, reference the built artifact from Pulumi.</p>
<p>My Go function looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func Handler(request events.APIGatewayProxyRequest) (events.APIGatewayProxyResponse, error) {

 return events.APIGatewayProxyResponse{
  Body:       &quot;\&quot;Hi from Golang lambda\&quot;&quot;,
  StatusCode: 200,
 }, nil

}</code></pre>
<p>Because I&#39;m on Windows but AWS Lambda runs on Linux, I had to use 
<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go"><code>build-lambda-zip</code></a> 
tool to make the package compatible. Here is the PowerShell build script:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">$env:GOOS = &quot;linux&quot;
$env:GOARCH = &quot;amd64&quot;
go build -o main main.go
~\Go\bin\build-lambda-zip.exe -o main.zip main</code></pre>
<p>and Pulumi function definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const golangLambda = new aws.lambda.Function(&quot;aws-hellolambda-golang&quot;, {
    runtime: aws.lambda.Go1dxRuntime,
    code: new pulumi.asset.FileArchive(&quot;./go/main.zip&quot;),
    timeout: 5,
    handler: &quot;main&quot;,
    role: role.arn
});</code></pre>
<h2 id="java">Java</h2>
<p>Java class implements an interface from AWS SDK:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class Hello implements RequestStreamHandler {

    public void handleRequest(InputStream inputStream, OutputStream outputStream, Context context) throws IOException {

        JSONObject responseJson = new JSONObject();

        responseJson.put(&quot;isBase64Encoded&quot;, false);
        responseJson.put(&quot;statusCode&quot;, &quot;200&quot;);
        responseJson.put(&quot;body&quot;, &quot;\&quot;Hi from Java lambda\&quot;&quot;);  

        OutputStreamWriter writer = new OutputStreamWriter(outputStream, &quot;UTF-8&quot;);
        writer.write(responseJson.toJSONString());  
        writer.close();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>I compiled this code with Maven (<code>mvn package</code>), which produced a <code>jar</code> file. AWS Lambda accepts
<code>jar</code> directly, but Pulumi&#39;s <code>FileArchive</code> is unfortunately crashing on trying
to read it.</p>
<p>As a workaround, I had to define a <code>zip</code> file with <code>jar</code> placed inside <code>lib</code>
folder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">const javaLambda = new aws.lambda.Function(&quot;aws-coldstart-java&quot;, {
    code: new pulumi.asset.AssetArchive({
        &quot;lib/lambda-java-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar&quot;: new pulumi.asset.FileAsset(&quot;./java/target/lambda-java-example-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar&quot;),
    }),
    runtime: aws.lambda.Java8Runtime,
    timeout: 5,
    handler: &quot;example.Hello&quot;,
    role: role.arn
});</code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The complete code for 5 lambda functions in 5 different programming languages
can be found in <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/pulumi-aws-serverless-examples">my github repository</a>.</p>
<p>Running <code>pulumi update</code> provisions 25 AWS resources in a matter of 1 minute,
so I can start playing with my test lambdas in no time.</p>
<p>And the best part: when I don&#39;t need them anymore, I run <code>pulumi destroy</code> and
my AWS Console is clean again!</p>
<p>Happy serverless moments!</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I love functional programming for the simplicity that it brings.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I realize that learning functional programming is a challenging 
process. FP comes with a baggage of unfamiliar vocabulary that can be daunting for 
somebody coming from an object-oriented language like C#.</p>
<p><img src="/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again//functional-programming-word-cloud.png" alt="Functional Programming Word Cloud"></p>
<p><em>Some of functional lingo</em></p>
<p>&quot;Monad&quot; is probably the most infamous term from the list above. Monads have reputation of being 
something very abstract and very confusing. </p>
<h2 id="the-fallacy-of-monad-tutorials">The Fallacy of Monad Tutorials</h2>
<p>Numerous attempts were made to explain monads in simple definitions; and monad tutorials have become a
genre of its own. And yet, times and times again, they fail to enlighten the readers.</p>
<p>The shortest explanation of monads looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again//monoid-endofunctors.png" alt="A Monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors"></p>
<p>It&#39;s both mathematically correct and totally useless to anybody learning functional programming. To
understand this statement, one has to know the terms &quot;monoid&quot;, &quot;category&quot; and &quot;endofunctors&quot; and be able
to mentally compose them into something meaningful.</p>
<p>The same problem is apparent in most monad tutorials. They assume some pre-existing knowledge in
heads of their readers, and if that assumption fails, the tutorial doesn&#39;t click.</p>
<p>Focusing too much on mechanics of monads instead of explaining why they are important is another
common problem.</p>
<p>Douglas Crockford grasped this fallacy very well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The monadic curse is that once someone learns what monads are and how to use them, they lose the ability to explain them to other people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem here is likely the following. Every person who understands monads had their own path to
this knowledge. It hasn&#39;t come all at once, instead there was a series of steps, each giving an insight,
until the last final step made the puzzle complete.</p>
<p>But they don&#39;t remember the whole path anymore. They go online and blog about that very last step as
the key to understanding, joining the club of flawed explanations.</p>
<p>There is an actual <a href="http://tomasp.net/academic/papers/monads/monads-programming.pdf">academic paper from Tomas Petricek</a> 
that studies monad tutorials.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve read that paper and a dozen of monad tutorials online. And of course, now I came up with my own.</p>
<p>I&#39;m probably doomed to fail too, at least for some readers. Yet, I know that many people found the
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/01/monads-explained-in-csharp/">previous version</a> of this article useful.</p>
<p>I based my explanation on examples from C# - the object-oriented language familiar to .NET developers.</p>
<h2 id="story-of-composition">Story of Composition</h2>
<p>The base element of each functional program is Function. In typed languages each function 
is just a mapping between the type of its input parameter and output parameter.
Such type can be annotated as <code>func: TypeA -&gt; TypeB</code>.</p>
<p>C# is object-oriented language, so we use methods to declare functions. There are two ways 
to define a method comparable to <code>func</code> function above. I can use static method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static class Mapper 
{
    static ClassB func(ClassA a) { ... }
}</code></pre>
<p>... or instance method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class ClassA 
{
    // Instance method
    ClassB func() { ... }
}</code></pre>
<p>Static form looks closer to the function annotation, but both ways are actually equivalent
for the purpose of our discussion. I will use instance methods in my examples, however all of
them could be written as static extension methods too.</p>
<p>How do we compose more complex workflows, programs and applications out of such simple
building blocks? A lot of patterns both in OOP and FP worlds revolve around this question.
And monads are one of the answers.</p>
<p>My sample code is going to be about conferences and speakers. The method implementations 
aren&#39;t really important, just watch the types carefully. There are 4 classes (types) and 
3 methods (functions):</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class Speaker 
{
    Talk NextTalk() { ... }
}

class Talk 
{
    Conference GetConference() { ... }
}

class Conference 
{
    City GetCity() { ... }
}

class City { ... }</code></pre>
<p>These methods are currently very easy to compose into a workflow:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static City NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    Talk talk = speaker.NextTalk();
    Conference conf = talk.GetConference();
    City city = conf.GetCity();
    return city;
}</code></pre>
<p>Because the return type of the previous step always matches the input type of the next step, we can
write it even shorter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static City NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .NextTalk()
        .GetConference()
        .GetCity();
}</code></pre>
<p>This code looks quite readable. It&#39;s concise and it flows from top to bottom, from left to right, 
similar to how we are used to read any text. There is not much noise too.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not what real codebases look like though, because there are multiple complications
along the happy composition path. Let&#39;s look at some of them.</p>
<h2 id="nulls">NULLs</h2>
<p>Any class instance in C# can be <code>null</code>. In the example above I might get runtime errors if
one of the methods ever returns <code>null</code> back.</p>
<p>Typed functional programming always tries to be explicit about types, so I&#39;ll re-write the signatures
of my methods to annotate the return types as nullables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class Speaker 
{
    Nullable&lt;Talk&gt; NextTalk() { ... }
}

class Talk 
{
    Nullable&lt;Conference&gt; GetConference() { ... }
}

class Conference 
{
    Nullable&lt;City&gt; GetCity() { ... }
}

class City { ... }</code></pre>
<p>This is actually invalid syntax in current C# version, because <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> and its short form
<code>T?</code> are not applicable to reference types. This <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/11/15/nullable-reference-types-in-csharp/">might change in C# 8</a>
though, so bear with me.</p>
<p>Now, when composing our workflow, we need to take care of <code>null</code> results:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static Nullable&lt;City&gt; NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    Nullable&lt;Talk&gt; talk = speaker.NextTalk();
    if (talk == null) return null;

    Nullable&lt;Conference&gt; conf = talk.GetConference();
    if (conf == null) return null;

    Nullable&lt;City&gt; city = conf.GetCity();
    return city;
}</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s still the same method, but it got more noise now. Even though I used short-circuit returns
and one-liners, it still got harder to read.</p>
<p>To fight that problem, smart language designers came up with the Null Propagation Operator:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static Nullable&lt;City&gt; NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        ?.NextTalk()
        ?.GetConference()
        ?.GetCity();
}</code></pre>
<p>Now we are almost back to our original workflow code: it&#39;s clean and concise, we just got
3 extra <code>?</code> symbols around.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take another leap.</p>
<h2 id="collections">Collections</h2>
<p>Quite often a function returns a collection of items, not just a single item. To some extent,
that&#39;s a generalization of <code>null</code> case: with <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> we might get 0 or 1 results back,
while with a collection we can get <code>0</code> to any <code>n</code> results.</p>
<p>Our sample API could look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class Speaker 
{
    List&lt;Talk&gt; GetTalks() { ... }
}

class Talk 
{
    List&lt;Conference&gt; GetConferences() { ... }
}

class Conference 
{
    List&lt;City&gt; GetCities() { ... }
}</code></pre>
<p>I used <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> but it could be any class or plain <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> interface.</p>
<p>How would we combine the methods into one workflow? Traditional version would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static List&lt;City&gt; AllCitiesToVisit(Speaker speaker) 
{
    var result = new List&lt;City&gt;();

    foreach (Talk talk in speaker.GetTalks())
        foreach (Conference conf in talk.GetConferences())
            foreach (City city in conf.GetCities())
                result.Add(city);

    return result;
}</code></pre>
<p>It reads ok-ish still. But the combination of nested loops and mutation with some conditionals sprinkled 
on them can get unreadable pretty soon. The exact workflow might be lost in the mechanics.</p>
<p>As an alternative, C# language designers invented LINQ extension methods. We can write code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static List&lt;City&gt; AllCitiesToVisit(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .GetTalks()
        .SelectMany(talk =&gt; talk.GetConferences())
        .SelectMany(conf =&gt; conf.GetCities())
        .ToList();
}</code></pre>
<p>Let me do one further trick and format the same code in an unusual way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static List&lt;City&gt; AllCitiesToVisit(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .GetTalks()           .SelectMany(x =&gt; x
        .GetConferences()    ).SelectMany(x =&gt; x
        .GetCities()         ).ToList();
}</code></pre>
<p>Now you can see the same original code on the left, combined with just a bit of technical repeatable
clutter on the right. Hold on, I&#39;ll show you where I&#39;m going.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s discuss another possible complication.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-calls">Asynchronous Calls</h2>
<p>What if our methods need to access some remote database or service to produce the results? This
should be shown in type signature, and C# has <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> for that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class Speaker 
{
    Task&lt;Talk&gt; NextTalk() { ... }
}

class Talk 
{
    Task&lt;Conference&gt; GetConference() { ... }
}

class Conference 
{
    Task&lt;City&gt; GetCity() { ... }
}</code></pre>
<p>This change breaks our nice workflow composition again.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll get back to async-await later, but the original way to combine <code>Task</code>-based
methods was to use <code>ContinueWith</code> and <code>Unwrap</code> API:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static Task&lt;City&gt; NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .NextTalk()
        .ContinueWith(talk =&gt; talk.Result.GetConference())
        .Unwrap()
        .ContinueWith(conf =&gt; conf.Result.GetCity())
        .Unwrap();
}</code></pre>
<p>Hard to read, but let me apply my formatting trick again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static Task&lt;City&gt; NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .NextTalk()         .ContinueWith(x =&gt; x.Result
        .GetConference()   ).Unwrap().ContinueWith(x =&gt; x.Result
        .GetCity()         ).Unwrap();
}</code></pre>
<p>You can see that, once again, it&#39;s our nice readable workflow on the left + some mechanical repeatable
junction code on the right.</p>
<h2 id="pattern">Pattern</h2>
<p>Can you see a pattern yet?</p>
<p>I&#39;ll repeat the <code>Nullable</code>-, <code>List</code>- and <code>Task</code>-based workflows again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static Nullable&lt;City&gt; NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker               ?
        .NextTalk()           ?
        .GetConference()      ?
        .GetCity();
}

static List&lt;City&gt; AllCitiesToVisit(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .GetTalks()            .SelectMany(x =&gt; x
        .GetConferences()     ).SelectMany(x =&gt; x
        .GetCities()          ).ToList();
}

static Task&lt;City&gt; NextTalkCity(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .NextTalk()            .ContinueWith(x =&gt; x.Result
        .GetConference()      ).Unwrap().ContinueWith(x =&gt; x.Result
        .GetCity()            ).Unwrap();
}</code></pre>
<p>In all 3 cases there was a complication which prevented us from sequencing method
calls fluently. In all 3 cases we found the gluing code to get back to fluent composition.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s try to generalize this approach. Given some generic container type 
<code>WorkflowThatReturns&lt;T&gt;</code>, we have a method to combine an instance of such workflow with
a function which accepts the result of that workflow and returns another workflow back:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class WorkflowThatReturns&lt;T&gt; 
{
    WorkflowThatReturns&lt;U&gt; AddStep(Func&lt;T, WorkflowThatReturns&lt;U&gt;&gt; step);
}</code></pre>
<p>In case this is hard to grasp, have a look at the picture of what is going on:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again//monad-bind.png" alt="Monad Bind Internals"></p>
<ol>
<li><p>An instance of type <code>T</code> sits in a generic container.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We call <code>AddStep</code> with a function, which maps <code>T</code> to <code>U</code> sitting inside yet another
container. </p>
</li>
<li><p>We get an instance of <code>U</code> but inside two containers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two containers are automatically unwrapped into a single container to get back to the
original shape.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now we are ready to add another step!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following code, <code>NextTalk</code> returns the first instance inside the container:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">WorkflowThatReturns&lt;City&gt; Workflow(Speaker speaker) 
{
    return 
        speaker
        .NextTalk()         
        .AddStep(x =&gt; x.GetConference())
        .AddStep(x =&gt; x.GetCity()); 
}</code></pre>
<p>Subsequently, <code>AddStep</code> is called two times to transfer to <code>Conference</code> and then
<code>City</code> inside the same container:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again//monad-two-binds.png" alt="Monad Bind Chaining"></p>
<h2 id="finally-monads">Finally, Monads</h2>
<p>The name of this pattern is <strong>Monad</strong>.</p>
<p>In C# terms, a Monad is a generic class with two operations: constructor and bind.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class Monad&lt;T&gt; {
    Monad(T instance);
    Monad&lt;U&gt; Bind(Func&lt;T, Monad&lt;U&gt;&gt; f);
}</code></pre>
<p>Constructor is used to put an object into container, <code>Bind</code> is used to replace one
contained object with another contained object.</p>
<p>It&#39;s important that <code>Bind</code>&#39;s argument returns <code>Monad&lt;U&gt;</code> and not just <code>U</code>. We can think
of <code>Bind</code> as a combination of <code>Map</code> and <code>Unwrap</code> as defined per following signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">class Monad&lt;T&gt; {
    Monad(T instance);
    Monad&lt;U&gt; Map(Function&lt;T, U&gt; f);
    static Monad&lt;U&gt; Unwrap(Monad&lt;Monad&lt;U&gt;&gt; nested);
}</code></pre>
<p>Even though I spent quite some time with examples, I expect you to be slightly confused
at this point. That&#39;s ok.</p>
<p>Keep going and let&#39;s have a look at several sample implementations of Monad pattern.</p>
<p><a name="maybe" href="/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again/undefined"></a></p>
<h2 id="maybe-option-">Maybe (Option)</h2>
<p>My first motivational example was with <code>Nullable&lt;T&gt;</code> and <code>?.</code>. The full pattern
containing either 0 or 1 instance of some type is called <code>Maybe</code> (it maybe has a value,
or maybe not).</p>
<p><code>Maybe</code> is another approach to dealing with &#39;no value&#39; value, alternative to the 
concept of <code>null</code>. </p>
<p>Functional-first language F# typically doesn&#39;t allow <code>null</code> for its types. Instead, F# has 
a maybe implementation built into the language: 
it&#39;s called <code>option</code> type. </p>
<p>Here is a sample implementation in C#:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class Maybe&lt;T&gt; where T : class
{
    private readonly T value;

    public Maybe(T someValue)
    {
        if (someValue == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(someValue));
        this.value = someValue;
    }

    private Maybe()
    {
    }

    public Maybe&lt;U&gt; Bind&lt;U&gt;(Func&lt;T, Maybe&lt;U&gt;&gt; func) where U : class
    {
        return value != null ? func(value) : Maybe&lt;U&gt;.None();
    }

    public static Maybe&lt;T&gt; None() =&gt; new Maybe&lt;T&gt;();
}</code></pre>
<p>When <code>null</code> is not allowed, any API contract gets more explicit: either you
return type <code>T</code> and it&#39;s always going to be filled, or you return <code>Maybe&lt;T&gt;</code>.
The client will see that <code>Maybe</code> type is used, so it will be forced to handle 
the case of absent value.</p>
<p>Given an imaginary repository contract (which does something with customers and
orders):</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public interface IMaybeAwareRepository
{
    Maybe&lt;Customer&gt; GetCustomer(int id);
    Maybe&lt;Address&gt; GetAddress(int id);
    Maybe&lt;Order&gt; GetOrder(int id);
}</code></pre>
<p>The client can be written with <code>Bind</code> method composition, without branching, 
in fluent style:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">Maybe&lt;Shipper&gt; shipperOfLastOrderOnCurrentAddress =
    repo.GetCustomer(customerId)
        .Bind(c =&gt; c.Address)
        .Bind(a =&gt; repo.GetAddress(a.Id))
        .Bind(a =&gt; a.LastOrder)
        .Bind(lo =&gt; repo.GetOrder(lo.Id))
        .Bind(o =&gt; o.Shipper);</code></pre>
<p>As we saw above, this syntax looks very much like a LINQ query with a bunch 
of <code>SelectMany</code> statements. One of the common 
implementations of <code>Maybe</code> implements <code>IEnumerable</code> interface to enable
a more C#-idiomatic binding composition. Actually:</p>
<h2 id="enumerable-selectmany-is-a-monad-">Enumerable + SelectMany is a Monad </h2>
<p><code>IEnumerable</code> is an interface for enumerable containers.</p>
<p>Enumerable containers can be created - thus the constructor monadic operation.</p>
<p>The <code>Bind</code> operation is defined by the standard LINQ extension method, here 
is its signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public static IEnumerable&lt;U&gt; SelectMany&lt;T, U&gt;(
    this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; first, 
    Func&lt;T, IEnumerable&lt;U&gt;&gt; selector)</code></pre>
<p>Direct implementation is quite straightforward:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static class Enumerable 
{
    public static IEnumerable&lt;U&gt; SelectMany(
        this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; values, 
        Func&lt;T, IEnumerable&lt;U&gt;&gt; func) 
    { 
        foreach (var item in values)
            foreach (var subItem in func(item))
                yield return subItem;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>And here is an example of composition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">IEnumerable&lt;Shipper&gt; shippers =
    customers
        .SelectMany(c =&gt; c.Addresses)
        .SelectMany(a =&gt; a.Orders)
        .SelectMany(o =&gt; o.Shippers);</code></pre>
<p>The query has no idea about how the collections are stored (encapsulated in
containers). We use functions <code>T -&gt; IEnumerable&lt;U&gt;</code> to produce new enumerables
(<code>Bind</code> operation).</p>
<h2 id="task-future-">Task (Future)</h2>
<p>In C# <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code> type is used to denote asynchronous computation which will eventually
return an instance of <code>T</code>. The other names for similar concepts in other languages
are <code>Promise</code> and <code>Future</code>.</p>
<p>While the typical usage of <code>Task</code> in C# is different from the Monad pattern we
discussed, I can still come up with a <code>Future</code> class with the familiar structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public class Future&lt;T&gt;
{
    private readonly Task&lt;T&gt; instance;

    public Future(T instance)
    {
        this.instance = Task.FromResult(instance);
    }

    private Future(Task&lt;T&gt; instance)
    {
        this.instance = instance;
    }

    public Future&lt;U&gt; Bind&lt;U&gt;(Func&lt;T, Future&lt;U&gt;&gt; func)
    {
        var a = this.instance.ContinueWith(t =&gt; func(t.Result).instance).Unwrap();
        return new Future&lt;U&gt;(a);
    }

    public void OnComplete(Action&lt;T&gt; action)
    {
        this.instance.ContinueWith(t =&gt; action(t.Result));
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Effectively, it&#39;s just a wrapper around the <code>Task</code> which doesn&#39;t add too much value,
but it&#39;s a useful illustration because now we can do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">repository
    .LoadSpeaker()
    .Bind(speaker =&gt; speaker.NextTalk())
    .Bind(talk =&gt; talk.GetConference())
    .Bind(conference =&gt; conference.GetCity())
    .OnComplete(city =&gt; reservations.BookFlight(city));</code></pre>
<p>We are back to the familiar structure. Time for some more complications.</p>
<h2 id="non-sequential-workflows">Non-Sequential Workflows</h2>
<p>Up until now, all the composed workflows had very liniar, sequential
structure: the output of a previous step was always the input for the next step.
That piece of data could be discarded after the first use because it was never needed 
for later steps:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again//linear-workflow.png" alt="Linear Workflow"></p>
<p>Quite often though, this might not be the case. A workflow step might need data
from two or more previous steps combined.</p>
<p>In the example above, <code>BookFlight</code> method might actually need both <code>Speaker</code> and
<code>City</code> objects:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/07/monads-explained-in-csharp-again//non-linear-workflow.png" alt="Non Linear Workflow"></p>
<p>In this case, we would have to use closure to save <code>speaker</code> object until we get
a <code>talk</code> too:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">repository
    .LoadSpeaker()
    .OnComplete(speaker =&gt;
        speaker
            .NextTalk()
            .Bind(talk =&gt; talk.GetConference())
            .Bind(conference =&gt; conference.GetCity())
            .OnComplete(city =&gt; reservations.BookFlight(speaker, city))
        );</code></pre>
<p>Obviously, this gets ugly very soon.</p>
<p>To solve this structural problem, C# language got its <code>async</code>-<code>await</code> feature,
which is now being reused in more languages including Javascript.</p>
<p>If we move back to using <code>Task</code> instead of our custom <code>Future</code>, we are able to
write</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var speaker = await repository.LoadSpeaker();
var talk = await speaker.NextTalk();
var conference = await talk.GetConference();
var city = await conference.GetCity();
await reservations.BookFlight(speaker, city);</code></pre>
<p>Even though we lost the fluent syntax, at least the block has just one level,
which makes it easier to navigate.</p>
<h2 id="monads-in-functional-languages">Monads in Functional Languages</h2>
<p>So far we learned that</p>
<ul>
<li>Monad is a workflow composition pattern</li>
<li>This pattern is used in functional programming</li>
<li>Special syntax helps simplify the usage</li>
</ul>
<p>It should come at no surprise that functional languages support monads on syntactic
level.</p>
<p>F# is a functional-first language running on .NET framework. F# had its own way of
doing workflows comparable to <code>async</code>-<code>await</code> before C# got it. In F#, the above
code would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let sendReservation () = async {
    let! speaker = repository.LoadSpeaker()
    let! talk = speaker.nextTalk()
    let! conf = talk.getConference()
    let! city = conf.getCity()
    do! bookFlight(speaker, city)
}</code></pre>
<p>Apart from syntax (<code>!</code> instead of <code>await</code>), the major difference to C# is that
<code>async</code> is just one possible monad type to be used this way. There are many
other monads in F# standard library (they are called Computation Expressions).</p>
<p>The best part is that any developer can create their own monads, and then use
all the power of language features.</p>
<p>Say, we want a hand-made <code>Maybe</code> computation expressoin in F#:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let nextTalkCity (speaker: Speaker) = maybe {
    let! talk = speaker.nextTalk()
    let! conf = talk.getConference()
    let! city = conf.getCity(talk)
    return city
}</code></pre>
<p>To make this code runnable, we need to define Maybe computation expression
builder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type MaybeBuilder() =

    member this.Bind(x, f) = 
        match x with
        | None -&gt; None
        | Some a -&gt; f a

    member this.Return(x) = 
        Some x

let maybe = new MaybeBuilder()</code></pre>
<p>I won&#39;t explain the details of what happens here, but you can see that the code is
quite trivial. Note the presence of <code>Bind</code> operation (and <code>Return</code> operation being
the monad constructor).</p>
<p>The feature is widely used by third-party F# libraries. Here is an actor definition
in Akka.NET F# API:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let loop () = actor {
    let! message = mailbox.Receive()
    match message with
    | Greet(name) -&gt; printfn &quot;Hello %s&quot; name
    | Hi -&gt; printfn &quot;Hello from F#!&quot;
    return! loop ()
}</code></pre>
<h2 id="monad-laws">Monad Laws</h2>
<p>There are a couple laws that constructor and <code>Bind</code> need to adhere to, so
that they produce a proper monad.</p>
<p>A typical monad tutorial will make a lot of emphasis on the laws, but I find them
less important to explain to a beginner. Nonetheless, here they are for the sake
of completeness.</p>
<p><strong>Left Identity law</strong> says that Monad constructor is a neutral operation: you can safely
run it before <code>Bind</code>, and it won&#39;t change the result of the function call:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">// Given
T value;
Func&lt;T, Monad&lt;U&gt;&gt; f;

// Then (== means both parts are equivalent)
new Monad&lt;T&gt;(value).Bind(f) == f(value) </code></pre>
<p><strong>Right Identity law</strong> says that given a monadic value, wrapping its contained data
into another monad of same type and then <code>Bind</code>ing it, doesn&#39;t change the original value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">// Given
Monad&lt;T&gt; monadicValue;

// Then (== means both parts are equivalent)
monadicValue.Bind(x =&gt; new Monad&lt;T&gt;(x)) == monadicValue</code></pre>
<p><strong>Associativity law</strong> means that the order in which <code>Bind</code> operations
are composed does not matter:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">// Given
Monad&lt;T&gt; m;
Func&lt;T, Monad&lt;U&gt;&gt; f;
Func&lt;U, Monad&lt;V&gt;&gt; g;

// Then (== means both parts are equivalent)
m.Bind(f).Bind(g) == m.Bind(a =&gt; f(a).Bind(g))</code></pre>
<p>The laws may look complicated, but in fact they are very natural 
expectations that any developer has when working with monads, so don&#39;t
spend too much mental effort on memorizing them.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You should not be afraid of the &quot;M-word&quot; just because you are a C# programmer. </p>
<p>C# does not have a notion of monads as predefined language constructs, but 
that doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t borrow some ideas from the functional world. Having 
said that, it&#39;s also true that C# is lacking some powerful ways to combine 
and generalize monads that are available in functional programming
languages.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2018/06/programmable-cloud-provisioning-azure-app-service-with-pulumi/'>Programmable Cloud: Provisioning Azure App Service with Pulumi</a></h1>
    

    

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Modern Cloud providers offer a wide variety of services of different types
and levels. A modern cloud application would leverage multiple services
in order to be efficient in terms of developer experience, price, operations
etc.</p>
<p>For instance, a very simple Web Application deployed to Azure PaaS services
could use</p>
<ul>
<li>App Service - to host the application</li>
<li>App Service Plan - to define the instance size, price, scaling and other
hosting parameters</li>
<li>Azure SQL Database - to store relational data</li>
<li>Application Insights - to collect telemetry and logs</li>
<li>Storage Account - to store the binaries and leverage Run-as-Zip feature</li>
</ul>
<p>Provisioning such environment becomes a task on its own:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we create the initial setup?</li>
<li>How do we make changes?</li>
<li>What if we need multiple environments?</li>
<li>How do we apply settings?</li>
<li>How do we recycle resources which aren&#39;t needed anymore?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, there are several options.</p>
<h2 id="manually-in-azure-portal">Manually in Azure Portal</h2>
<p>We all start doing this in Azure Portal. User Interface is great for
discovering new services and features, and it&#39;s a quick way to make a single
change.</p>
<p><img src="/2018/06/programmable-cloud-provisioning-azure-app-service-with-pulumi//azureportal.png" alt="Azure Portal"></p>
<p><em>Creating an App Service in Azure Portal</em></p>
<p>Clicking buttons manually doesn&#39;t scale though. After the initial setup is
complete, maintaining the environment over time poses significant challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every change requires going back to the portal, finding the right resource
and doing the right change</li>
<li>People make mistakes, so if you have multiple environments, they are likely
to be different in subtle ways</li>
<li>Naming gets messy over time</li>
<li>There is no easily accessible history of environment changes</li>
<li>Cleaning up is hard: usually some leftovers will remain unnoticed</li>
<li>Skills are required from everybody involved in provisioning</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how do we streamline this process?</p>
<h2 id="azure-powershell-cli-and-management-sdks">Azure PowerShell, CLI and Management SDKs</h2>
<p>Azure comes with a powerful set of tools to manage resources with code.</p>
<p>You can use PowerShell, CLI scripts or custom code like C# to do with code
whatever is possible to do via portal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">var webApp = azure.WebApps.Define(appName)
    .WithRegion(Region.WestEurope)
    .WithNewResourceGroup(rgName)
    .WithNewFreeAppServicePlan()
    .Create();</code></pre>
<p><em>Fluent C# code creating an App Service</em></p>
<p>However, those commands are usually expressed in imperative style of 
CRUD operations. You can run the commands once, but it&#39;s hard to modify
existing resources from an arbitrary state to the desired end state.</p>
<h2 id="azure-resource-manager-templates">Azure Resource Manager Templates</h2>
<p>All services in Azure are managed by Azure Resource Manager (ARM). ARM 
has a special JSON-based format for templates. </p>
<p>Once a template is defined,
it&#39;s relatively straightforward to be deployed to Azure environment. So, if
resources are defined in JSON, they will be created automatically via
PowerShell or CLI commands.</p>
<p>It is also possible to deploy templates in incremental mode, when the tool
will compare existing environment with desired configuration and will deploy
the difference.</p>
<p>Templates can be parametrized, which enables multi-environment deployments.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a problem with templates though: they are JSON files. They get
very large very fast, they are hard to reuse, it&#39;s easy to make a typo.</p>
<p><img src="/2018/06/programmable-cloud-provisioning-azure-app-service-with-pulumi//armtemplate.png" alt="ARM Template"></p>
<p><em>A fragment of auto-generated ARM Template for App Service, note the 
line numbers</em></p>
<p>Terraform is another templating tool to provision cloud resources but it uses
YAML instead of JSON. I don&#39;t have much experience with it, but the problems 
seem to be very similar.</p>
<p>Can we combine the power of SDKs and the power of JSON-/YAML-based desired state
configuration tools?</p>
<h2 id="pulumi">Pulumi</h2>
<p>One potential solution has just arrived.
A startup called Pulumi <a href="http://joeduffyblog.com/2018/06/18/hello-pulumi/">just went out of private beta to open source</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/2018/06/programmable-cloud-provisioning-azure-app-service-with-pulumi//pulumi.jpg" alt="Pulumi"></p>
<p>Pulumi wants to be much more than a better version of ARM templates, aiming
to become the tool to build cloud-first distributed systems. But for today I&#39;ll 
focus on lower level of resource provisioning task.</p>
<p>With Pulumi cloud infrastructure is defined in code using full-blown general 
purpose programming languages.</p>
<p>The workflow goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a Stack, which is a container for a group of related resources</li>
<li>Write a program in one of supported languages (I&#39;ll use TypeScript) which
references <code>pulumi</code> libraries and constructs all the resources as objects</li>
<li>Establish connection with your Azure account</li>
<li>Call <code>pulumi</code> CLI to create, update or destroy Azure resources based on
the program</li>
<li>Pulumi will first show the preview of changes, and then apply them as
requested</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pulumi-program">Pulumi Program</h2>
<p>I&#39;m using TypeScript to define my Azure resources in Pulumi. So, the program
is a normal Node.js application with <code>index.ts</code> file, package references in 
<code>package.json</code> and one extra file <code>Pulumi.yaml</code> to define the program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">name: azure-appservice
runtime: nodejs</code></pre>
<p>Our <code>index.js</code> is as simple as a bunch of <code>import</code> statements followed by
creating TypeScript objects per desired resource. The simplest program can
look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">import * as pulumi from &quot;@pulumi/pulumi&quot;;
import * as azure from &quot;@pulumi/azure&quot;;

const resourceGroup = new azure.core.ResourceGroup(&quot;myrg&quot;, {
    location: &quot;West Europe&quot;
});</code></pre>
<p>When executed by <code>pulumi update</code> command, this program will create a new
Resource Group in your Azure subscription.</p>
<h2 id="chaining-resources">Chaining Resources</h2>
<p>When multiple resources are created, the properties of one resource will
depend on properties of the others. E.g. I&#39;ve defined the Resource Group
above, and now I want to create an App Service Plan under this Group:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const resourceGroupArgs = {
    resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,
    location: resourceGroup.location
};

const appServicePlan = new azure.appservice.Plan(&quot;myplan&quot;, {
    ...resourceGroupArgs,

    kind: &quot;App&quot;,

    sku: {
        tier: &quot;Basic&quot;,
        size: &quot;B1&quot;,
    },
});</code></pre>
<p>I&#39;ve assigned <code>resourceGroupName</code> and <code>location</code> of App Service Plan to
values from the Resource Group. It looks like a simple assignment of
strings but in fact it&#39;s more complicated.</p>
<p>Property <code>resourceGroup.name</code> has the type of <code>pulumi.Output&lt;string&gt;</code>.
Constructor argument <code>resourceGroupName</code> of <code>Plan</code> has the type of
<code>pulumi.Input&lt;string&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>We assigned <code>&quot;myrg&quot;</code> value to Resource Group name, but during the actual 
deployment it will change. Pulumi will append a unique identifier to the name,
so the actually provisioned group will be named e.g. <code>&quot;myrg65fb103e&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>This value will materialize inside <code>Output</code> type only at deployment time, 
and then it will get propagated to <code>Input</code> by Pulumi.</p>
<p>There is also a nice way to return the end values of <code>Output</code>&#39;s from Pulumi
program. Let&#39;s say we define an App Service:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const app = new azure.appservice.AppService(&quot;mywebsite&quot;, {
    ...resourceGroupArgs,

    appServicePlanId: appServicePlan.id
});</code></pre>
<p>First, notice how we used TypeScript spread operator to reuse
properties from <code>resourceGroupArgs</code>.</p>
<p>Second, <code>Output</code>-<code>Input</code> assignment got used again to propagate App Service
Plan ID.</p>
<p>Lastly, we can now export App Service host name from our program, e.g.
for the user to be able to go to the web site immediately after deployment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">exports.hostname = app.defaultSiteHostname;</code></pre>
<p><code>Output</code> can also be transformed with <code>apply</code> function. Here is the code to
format output URL:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">exports.endpoint = app.defaultSiteHostname.apply(n =&gt; `https://${n}`);</code></pre>
<p>Running <code>pulumi update</code> from CLI will then print the endpoint for us:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">---outputs:---
endpoint: &quot;https://mywebsiteb76260b5.azurewebsites.net&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Multiple outputs can be combined with <code>pulumi.all</code>, e.g. given SQL Server
and Database, we could make a connection string:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const connectionString = 
    pulumi.all([sqlServer, database]).apply(([server, db]) =&gt; 
        `Server=tcp:${server}.database.windows.net;initial catalog=${db};user ID=${username};password=${pwd};Min Pool Size=0;Max Pool Size=30;Persist Security Info=true;`)</code></pre>
<h2 id="using-the-power-of-npm">Using the Power of NPM</h2>
<p>Since our program is just a TypeScript application, we are free to use any
3rd party package which exists out there in NPM.</p>
<p>For instance, we can install Azure Storage SDK. Just</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">npm install azure-storage@2.9.0-preview</code></pre>
<p>and then we can write a function to produce SAS token for a Blob in Azure
Storage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">import * as azurestorage from &quot;azure-storage&quot;;

// Given an Azure blob, create a SAS URL that can read it.
export function signedBlobReadUrl(
    blob: azure.storage.Blob | azure.storage.ZipBlob,
    account: azure.storage.Account,
    container: azure.storage.Container,
): pulumi.Output&lt;string&gt; {
    const signatureExpiration = new Date(2100, 1);

    return pulumi.all([
        account.primaryConnectionString,
        container.name,
        blob.name,
    ]).apply(([connectionString, containerName, blobName]) =&gt; {
        let blobService = new azurestorage.BlobService(connectionString);
        let signature = blobService.generateSharedAccessSignature(
            containerName,
            blobName,
            {
                AccessPolicy: {
                    Expiry: signatureExpiration,
                    Permissions: azurestorage.BlobUtilities.SharedAccessPermissions.READ,
                },
            }
        );

        return blobService.getUrl(containerName, blobName, signature);
    });
}</code></pre>
<p>I took this function from <a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-functions">Azure Functions</a>
example, and it will probably move to Pulumi libraries at some point, but until
then you are free to leverage the package ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="deploying-application-files">Deploying Application Files</h2>
<p>So far we provisioned Azure App Service, but we can also deploy the application
files as part of the same workflow.</p>
<p>The code below is using <a href="https://github.com/Azure/app-service-announcements/issues/84">Run from Zip</a>
feature of App Service:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Define Storage Account and Container</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts"> const storageAccount = new azure.storage.Account(&quot;mystorage&quot;, {
     ...resourceGroupArgs,

     accountKind: &quot;StorageV2&quot;,
     accountTier: &quot;Standard&quot;,
     accountReplicationType: &quot;LRS&quot;,
 });

 const storageContainer = new azure.storage.Container(&quot;mycontainer&quot;, {
     resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,
     storageAccountName: storageAccount.name,
     containerAccessType: &quot;private&quot;,
 });</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Create a folder with application files, e.g. <code>wwwroot</code>. It may contain
some test HTML, ASP.NET application, or anything supported by App Service.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Produce a zip file from that folder in Pulumi program:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts"> const blob = new azure.storage.ZipBlob(&quot;myzip&quot;, {
     resourceGroupName: resourceGroup.name,
     storageAccountName: storageAccount.name,
     storageContainerName: storageContainer.name,
     type: &quot;block&quot;,

     content: new pulumi.asset.FileArchive(&quot;wwwroot&quot;)
 });</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Produce SAS Blob URL and assign it to App Service Run-as-Zip setting:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts"> const codeBlobUrl = signedBlobReadUrl(blob, storageAccount, storageContainer);

 const app = new azure.appservice.AppService(&quot;mywebsite&quot;, {
     ...resourceGroupArgs,

     appServicePlanId: appServicePlan.id,

     appSettings: {
         &quot;WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_ZIP&quot;: codeBlobUrl
     }
 });</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Run the program, and your Application will start as soon as <code>pulumi update</code>
is complete.</p>
<h2 id="determinism">Determinism</h2>
<p>Pulumi programs should strive to be deterministic.
That means you should avoid using things like current date/time or random numbers.</p>
<p>The reason is incremental updates. Every time you run <code>pulumi update</code>, it
will execute the program from scratch. If your resources depend on random
values, they will not match the existing resources and thus the false
delta will be detected and deployed.</p>
<p>In the SAS generation example above we used a fixed date in the future
instead of doing today + 1 year kind of calculation.</p>
<p>Should Pulumi provide some workaround for this?</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>My code was kindly merged to 
<a href="https://github.com/pulumi/examples/tree/master/azure-ts-appservice">Pulumi examples</a>, 
go there for the complete runnable program that provisions App Service with
Azure SQL Database and Application Insights.</p>
<p>I really see high potential in Cloud-as-Code approach suggested by Pulumi.
Today we just scratched the surface of the possibilities. We were working
with cloud services on raw level: provisioning specific services with
given parameters.</p>
<p>Pulumi&#39;s vision includes providing higher-level components to blur the line
between infrastructure and code, and to enable everybody to create such
components on their own.</p>
<p>Exciting future ahead!</p>

    <h1><a href='/2018/05/azure-functions-cold-starts-beyond-first-load/'>Cold Starts Beyond First Request in Azure Functions</a></h1>
    

    

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>In my <a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers/">previous article</a>
I&#39;ve explored the topic of Cold Starts in Azure Functions. Particularly, I&#39;ve measured the
cold start delays per language and runtime version.</p>
<p>I received some follow-up questions that I&#39;d like to explore in today&#39;s post:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we avoid cold starts except the very first one by keeping the instance warm?</li>
<li>Given one warm instance, if two requests come at the same time, will one request hit 
a cold start because existing instance is busy with the other?</li>
<li>In general, does a cold start happen at scale-out when a new extra instance is provisioned?</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, we are only talking Consumption Plan here.</p>
<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>
<p>Azure Functions are running on instances provided by Azure App Service. Each instance is
able to process several requests concurrently, which is different comparing to AWS Lambda.</p>
<p>Thus, the following <em>could</em> be true:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we issue at least 1 request every 20 minutes, the first instance should stay warm for
long time</li>
<li>Simultaneous requests don&#39;t cause cold start unless the existing instance gets too busy</li>
<li>When runtime decides to scale out and spin up a new instance, it could do so in the background,
still forwarding incoming requests to the existing warm instance(s). Once the new instance
is ready, it could be added to the pool without causing cold starts</li>
<li>If so, cold starts are mitigated beyond the very first execution</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s put this theory under test!</p>
<h2 id="keeping-always-warm">Keeping Always Warm</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve tested a Function App which consists of two Functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTTP Function under test</li>
<li>Timer Function which runs every 10 minutes and does nothing but logging 1 line of text</li>
</ul>
<p>I then measured the cold start statistics similar to all the tests from my previous article.</p>
<p>During 2 days I was issuing infrequent requests to the same app, most of them would normally
lead to a cold start. Interestingly, even though I was regularly firing the timer, Azure 
switched instances to serve my application 2 times during the test period:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/05/azure-functions-cold-starts-beyond-first-load//cold-starts-keep-warm.png" alt="Infrequent Requests to Azure Functions with &quot;Keep It Warm&quot; Timer"></p>
<p>I can see that most responses are fast, so timer &quot;warmer&quot; definitely helps.</p>
<p>The first request(s) to a new instance are slower than subsequent ones. Still, they are faster
than normal full cold start time, so it could be related to HTTP stack loading.</p>
<p>Anyway, keeping Functions warm seems a viable strategy.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-requests">Parallel Requests</h2>
<p>What happens when there is a warm instance, but it&#39;s already busy with processing another
request? Will the parallel request be delayed, or will it be processed by the same
warm instance?</p>
<p>I tested with a very lightweight function, which nevertheless takes some time to complete:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public static async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; Delay500([HttpTrigger] HttpRequestMessage req)
{
    await Task.Delay(500);
    return req.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.OK, &quot;Done&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>I believe it&#39;s an OK approximation for an IO-bound function.</p>
<p>The test client then issued 2 to 10 parallel requests to this function and measured the
response time for all requests.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not the easiest chart to understand in full, but note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Each group of bars are for requests sent at the same time. Then there goes a pause about
20 seconds before the next group of requests gets sent</p>
</li>
<li><p>The bars are colored by the instance which processed that request: same instance - same
color</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/2018/05/azure-functions-cold-starts-beyond-first-load//cold-starts-during-simultaneous-requests.png" alt="Azure Functions Response Time to Batches of Simultaneous Requests"></p>
<p>Here are some observations from this experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Out of 64 requests, there were 11 cold starts</p>
</li>
<li><p>Same instance <em>can</em> process multiple simultaneous requests, e.g. one instance processed
7 out of 10 requests in the last batch</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nonetheless, Azure is eager to spin up new instances for multiple requests. In total
12 instances were created, which is even more than max amount of requests in any single
batch</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some of those instances were actually never reused (gray-ish bars in batched x2 and x3,
brown bar in x10)</p>
</li>
<li><p>The first request to each new instance pays the full cold start price. Runtime doesn&#39;t
provision them in background while reusing existing instances for received requests</p>
</li>
<li><p>If an instance handled more than one request at a time, response time invariably suffers,
even though the function is super lightweight (<code>Task.Delay</code>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Getting back to the experiment goals, there are several things that we learned.</p>
<p>For low-traffic apps with sporadic requests it makes sense to setup a &quot;warmer&quot; timer
function firing every 10 minutes or so to prevent the only instance from being recycled.</p>
<p>However, scale-out cold starts are real and I don&#39;t see any way to prevent them from
happening.</p>
<p>When multiple requests come in at the same time, we might expect some of them to hit
a new instance and get slowed down. The exact algorithm of instance reuse is not
entirely clear.</p>
<p>Same instance is capable of processing multiple requests in parallel, so there are
possibilities for optimization in terms of routing to warm instances during the
provisioning of cold ones. </p>
<p>If such optimizations happen, I&#39;ll be glad to re-run my tests and report any noticeable
improvements.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more serverless perf goodness!</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Auto-provisioning and auto-scalability are the killer features of Function-as-a-Service
cloud offerings, and Azure Functions in particular.</p>
<p>One drawback of such dynamic provisioning is a phenomenon called &quot;Cold Start&quot;. Basically,
applications that haven&#39;t been used for a while take longer to startup and to handle the
first request.</p>
<p>The problem is nicely described in 
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2018/02/07/understanding-serverless-cold-start/">Understanding Serverless Cold Start</a>,
so I won&#39;t repeat it here. I&#39;ll just copy a picture from that article:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstart.jpg" alt="Cold Start"></p>
<p>Based on the 4 actions which happen during a cold start, we may guess that the following factors
might affect the cold start duration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language / execution runtime</li>
<li>Azure Functions runtime version</li>
<li>Application size including dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>I ran several sample functions and tried to analyze the impact of these factors on cold start time.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>All tests were run against HTTP Functions, because that&#39;s where cold start matters the most.</p>
<p>All the functions were just returning &quot;Hello, World&quot; taking the &quot;World&quot; value from the query string.
Some functions were also loading extra dependencies, see below.</p>
<p>I did not rely on execution time reported by Azure. Instead, I measured end-to-end duration from
client perspective. All calls were made from within the same Azure region, so network latency should 
have minimal impact:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//test-setup.png" alt="Test Setup"></p>
<h2 id="when-does-cold-start-happen-">When Does Cold Start Happen?</h2>
<p>Obviously, cold start happens when the very first request comes in. After that request is processed,
the instance is kept alive in case subsequent requests arrive. But for how long?</p>
<p>The following chart gives the answer. It shows values of normalized request durations across
different languages and runtime versions (Y axis) depending on the time since the previous
request in minutes (X axis):</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstart-threshold.png" alt="Cold Start Threshold"></p>
<p>Clearly, an idle instance lives for 20 minutes and then gets recycled. All requests after 20 minutes
threshold hit another cold start.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-languages-compare-">How Do Languages Compare?</h2>
<p>I&#39;ll start with version 1 of Functions runtime, which is the production-ready GA version as of today.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written Hello World HTTP function in all GA languages: C#, F# and Javascript, and I added Python
for comparison. C#/F# were executed both in the form of script, and as a precompiled .NET assembly.</p>
<p>The following chart shows some intuition about the cold start duration per language. The languages
are ordered based on mean response time, from lowest to highest. 65% of request
durations are inside the vertical bar (1-sigma interval) and 95% are inside the vertical line (2-sigma):</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstarts-v1.png" alt="Cold Start V1 per Language"></p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, precompiled .NET is exactly on par with Javascript. Javascript &quot;Hello World&quot; 
is really lightweight, so I expected it to win, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>C# Script is slower but somewhat comparable. F# Script presented a really negative surprise though: it&#39;s much
slower. It&#39;s even slower than experimental Python support where no performance optimization would
be expected at all!</p>
<h2 id="functions-runtime-v1-vs-v2">Functions Runtime: V1 vs V2</h2>
<p>Version 2 of Functions runtime is currently in preview and not suitable for production load. That
probably means they haven&#39;t done too much performance optimization, especially from cold start
standpoint.</p>
<p>Can we see this on the chart? We sure can:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstarts-v2.png" alt="Cold Start V1 vs V2"></p>
<p>V2 is massively slower. The fastest cold starts are around 6 seconds, but the slowest can come
up to 40-50 seconds.</p>
<p>Javascript is again on-par with precompiled .NET. </p>
<p>Java is noticeably slower, even though the
deployment package is just 33kB, so I assume I didn&#39;t overblow it.</p>
<h2 id="does-size-matter-">Does Size Matter?</h2>
<p>OK, enough of Hello World. A real-life function might be more heavy, mainly because it would
depend on other third-party libraries.</p>
<p>To simulate such scenario, I&#39;ve measured cold starts for a .NET function with references to 
Entity Framework, Automapper, Polly and Serilog.</p>
<p>For Javascript I did the same, but referenced Bluebird, lodash and AWS SDK.</p>
<p>Here are the results:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstarts-dependencies.png" alt="Cold Start Dependencies"></p>
<p>As expected, the dependencies slow the loading down. You should keep your Functions lean,
otherwise you will pay in seconds for every cold start.</p>
<p>An important note for Javascript developers: the above numbers are for Functions deployed
after <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-pack"><code>Funcpack</code></a> preprocessor. The package
contained the single <code>js</code> file with Webpack-ed dependency tree. Without that, the mean
cold start time of the same function is 20 seconds!</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Here are some lessons learned from all the experiments above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be prepared for 1-3 seconds cold starts even for the smallest Functions</li>
<li>Stay on V1 of runtime until V2 goes GA unless you don&#39;t care about perf</li>
<li>.NET precompiled and Javascript Functions have roughly same cold start time</li>
<li>Minimize the amount of dependencies, only bring what&#39;s needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see anything weird or unexpected in my results? Do you need me to dig deeper on other aspects?
Please leave a comment below or ping me on twitter, and let&#39;s sort it all out.</p>
