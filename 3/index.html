    <h1><a href='/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers/'>Azure Functions: Cold Starts in Numbers</a></h1>
    

    

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Auto-provisioning and auto-scalability are the killer features of Function-as-a-Service
cloud offerings, and Azure Functions in particular.</p>
<p>One drawback of such dynamic provisioning is a phenomenon called &quot;Cold Start&quot;. Basically,
applications that haven&#39;t been used for a while take longer to startup and to handle the
first request.</p>
<p>The problem is nicely described in 
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2018/02/07/understanding-serverless-cold-start/">Understanding Serverless Cold Start</a>,
so I won&#39;t repeat it here. I&#39;ll just copy a picture from that article:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstart.jpg" alt="Cold Start"></p>
<p>Based on the 4 actions which happen during a cold start, we may guess that the following factors
might affect the cold start duration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language / execution runtime</li>
<li>Azure Functions runtime version</li>
<li>Application size including dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>I ran several sample functions and tried to analyze the impact of these factors on cold start time.</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>All tests were run against HTTP Functions, because that&#39;s where cold start matters the most.</p>
<p>All the functions were just returning &quot;Hello, World&quot; taking the &quot;World&quot; value from the query string.
Some functions were also loading extra dependencies, see below.</p>
<p>I did not rely on execution time reported by Azure. Instead, I measured end-to-end duration from
client perspective. All calls were made from within the same Azure region, so network latency should 
have minimal impact:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//test-setup.png" alt="Test Setup"></p>
<h2 id="when-does-cold-start-happen-">When Does Cold Start Happen?</h2>
<p>Obviously, cold start happens when the very first request comes in. After that request is processed,
the instance is kept alive in case subsequent requests arrive. But for how long?</p>
<p>The following chart gives the answer. It shows values of normalized request durations across
different languages and runtime versions (Y axis) depending on the time since the previous
request in minutes (X axis):</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstart-threshold.png" alt="Cold Start Threshold"></p>
<p>Clearly, an idle instance lives for 20 minutes and then gets recycled. All requests after 20 minutes
threshold hit another cold start.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-languages-compare-">How Do Languages Compare?</h2>
<p>I&#39;ll start with version 1 of Functions runtime, which is the production-ready GA version as of today.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written Hello World HTTP function in all GA languages: C#, F# and Javascript, and I added Python
for comparison. C#/F# were executed both in the form of script, and as a precompiled .NET assembly.</p>
<p>The following chart shows some intuition about the cold start duration per language. The languages
are ordered based on mean response time, from lowest to highest. 65% of request
durations are inside the vertical bar (1-sigma interval) and 95% are inside the vertical line (2-sigma):</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstarts-v1.png" alt="Cold Start V1 per Language"></p>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, precompiled .NET is exactly on par with Javascript. Javascript &quot;Hello World&quot; 
is really lightweight, so I expected it to win, but I was wrong.</p>
<p>C# Script is slower but somewhat comparable. F# Script presented a really negative surprise though: it&#39;s much
slower. It&#39;s even slower than experimental Python support where no performance optimization would
be expected at all!</p>
<h2 id="functions-runtime-v1-vs-v2">Functions Runtime: V1 vs V2</h2>
<p>Version 2 of Functions runtime is currently in preview and not suitable for production load. That
probably means they haven&#39;t done too much performance optimization, especially from cold start
standpoint.</p>
<p>Can we see this on the chart? We sure can:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstarts-v2.png" alt="Cold Start V1 vs V2"></p>
<p>V2 is massively slower. The fastest cold starts are around 6 seconds, but the slowest can come
up to 40-50 seconds.</p>
<p>Javascript is again on-par with precompiled .NET. </p>
<p>Java is noticeably slower, even though the
deployment package is just 33kB, so I assume I didn&#39;t overblow it.</p>
<h2 id="does-size-matter-">Does Size Matter?</h2>
<p>OK, enough of Hello World. A real-life function might be more heavy, mainly because it would
depend on other third-party libraries.</p>
<p>To simulate such scenario, I&#39;ve measured cold starts for a .NET function with references to 
Entity Framework, Automapper, Polly and Serilog.</p>
<p>For Javascript I did the same, but referenced Bluebird, lodash and AWS SDK.</p>
<p>Here are the results:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers//coldstarts-dependencies.png" alt="Cold Start Dependencies"></p>
<p>As expected, the dependencies slow the loading down. You should keep your Functions lean,
otherwise you will pay in seconds for every cold start.</p>
<p>An important note for Javascript developers: the above numbers are for Functions deployed
after <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-pack"><code>Funcpack</code></a> preprocessor. The package
contained the single <code>js</code> file with Webpack-ed dependency tree. Without that, the mean
cold start time of the same function is 20 seconds!</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Here are some lessons learned from all the experiments above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be prepared for 1-3 seconds cold starts even for the smallest Functions</li>
<li>Stay on V1 of runtime until V2 goes GA unless you don&#39;t care about perf</li>
<li>.NET precompiled and Javascript Functions have roughly same cold start time</li>
<li>Minimize the amount of dependencies, only bring what&#39;s needed</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you see anything weird or unexpected in my results? Do you need me to dig deeper on other aspects?
Please leave a comment below or ping me on twitter, and let&#39;s sort it all out.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2018/04/fsharp-exchange-2018/'>Awesome F# Exchange 2018</a></h1>
    

    

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>I&#39;m writing this post in the train to London Stensted, on my way back from F# Exchange 2018
conference.</p>
<p>F# Exchange is a yearly conference taking place in London, and 2018 edition was the first one
for me personally. I also had an honour to speak there about creating Azure Functions with
F#.</p>
<h2 id="impression">Impression</h2>
<p>F# is still relatively niche language, so the conference is not overcrowded, but that gives
it a special feeling of family gathering. There were 162 participants this year, and I have an
impression that every one of them is extremely friendly, enthusiastic and just plain awesome.</p>
<p>The conference itself had 2 tracks of 45-minute talks and 60-minute keynotes. Most talks were
of high quality, and the topics ranging from compiler internals to fun applications like 
music generation, car racing and map drawing.</p>
<p>Both Don Syme, the creator of F#, and Philip Carter, F# program manager, were there and gave
keynotes, but they were careful enough not to draw too much attention on Microsoft and let
the community speak loud.</p>
<h2 id="corridor-track">Corridor Track</h2>
<p>But the talks were just a part of the story. For me, the conference started in the evening
before the first day at the speakers drinks party, and only finished at 1 a.m. after the 
second day (the pubs in London are lovely).</p>
<p>I spoke to so many great people, I learnt a lot, and had fun too. I&#39;ve never seen so many
F# folks at the same place, and I guess there must be something about F# which attracts
the right kind of people to it.</p>
<p>And of course it&#39;s so much fun to meet face-to-face all those twitter, slack, github and 
Channel 9 persona&#39;s and to see that they are actually real people :)</p>
<h2 id="my-talk">My Talk</h2>
<p>The talk I gave was called &quot;Azure F#unctions&quot;. It was not a hard-core F# talk, but people
seemed to be genuinely interested in the topic.</p>
<p>A decent amount of attendees are already familiar with Azure Functions, and many either run 
them in production or plan to do so.</p>
<p>The reference version conflict problem is very well known and raises a lots of questions
or concerns. This even leads to workarounds like transpiling F# Functions to Javascript
with Fable. Yikes.</p>
<p>Durable Functions seem to be sparkling a lot of initial interest. I&#39;ll be definitely
spending more time to play with them, and maybe to make F# story more smooth.</p>
<p>Functions were mentioned in Philip&#39;s keynote as one of the important areas for F# 
application, which is cool. We should spend some extra effort to make the documentation
and onboarding story as smooth as possible.</p>
<h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2>
<p>Skills Matter is the company behind the conference. Carla, Nicole and others did a great
job preparing the event; everything went smooth, informal and fun.</p>
<p>The videos are already online at <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/9419-f-sharp-exchange-2018#skillscasts">Skillscasts</a> 
(requires free signup).</p>
<p><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/10869-f-sharp-exchange-2019">F# Exchange 2019</a> 
super early bird tickets are for sale now and until Monday April 9, go 
get one and join F# Exchange in London next year! </p>
<p>I&#39;m already missing you all.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2018/02/azure-durable-functions-in-fsharp/'>Azure Durable Functions in F#</a></h1>
    

    

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Azure Functions are designed for stateless, fast-to-execute,
simple actions. Typically, they are triggered by an HTTP call or a queue message,
then they read something from the storage or database and return the result
to the caller or send it to another queue. All within several seconds at most.</p>
<p>However, there exists a preview of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-overview">Durable Functions</a>,
an extension that lets you write stateful functions for long-running workflows.
Here is a picture of one possible workflow from the docs:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/02/azure-durable-functions-in-fsharp//fan-out-fan-in.png" alt="Fan-out Fan-in Workflow"></p>
<p>Such workflows might take arbitrary time to complete. Instead of blocking and
waiting for all that period, Durable Functions use the combination of
Storage Queues and Tables to do all the work asynchronously.</p>
<p>The code still <em>feels</em> like one continuous thing because it&#39;s programmed
as a single orchestrator function. So, it&#39;s easier for a human to reason 
about the functionality without the complexities of low-level communication.</p>
<p>I won&#39;t describe Durable Functions any further, just go read
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-overview">documentation</a>,
it&#39;s nice and clean.</p>
<h2 id="language-support">Language Support</h2>
<p>As of February 2018, Durable Functions are still in preview. That also means
that language support is limited:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Currently C# is the only supported language for Durable Functions. This 
includes orchestrator functions and activity functions. In the future, 
we will add support for all languages that Azure Functions supports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was a bit disappointed that F# is not an option. But actually, since
Durable Functions support precompiled .NET assembly model, pretty much
anything doable in C# can be done in F# too.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to show that you can write Durable Functions in F#.
I used precompiled .NET Standard 2.0 F# Function App running on 2.0 preview
runtime.</p>
<h2 id="orchestration-functions">Orchestration Functions</h2>
<p>The stateful workflows are Azure Functions with a special <code>OrchestrationTrigger</code>.
Since they are asynchronous, C# code is always based on <code>Task</code> and <code>async</code>-<code>await</code>.
Here is a simple example of orchestrator in C#:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public static async Task&lt;List&lt;string&gt;&gt; Run([OrchestrationTrigger] DurableOrchestrationContext context)
{
    var outputs = new List&lt;string&gt;();

    outputs.Add(await context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(&quot;E1_SayHello&quot;, &quot;Tokyo&quot;));
    outputs.Add(await context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(&quot;E1_SayHello&quot;, &quot;Seattle&quot;));
    outputs.Add(await context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(&quot;E1_SayHello&quot;, &quot;London&quot;));

    // returns [&quot;Hello Tokyo!&quot;, &quot;Hello Seattle!&quot;, &quot;Hello London!&quot;]
    return outputs;
}</code></pre>
<p>F# has its own preferred way of doing asynchronous code based on <code>async</code>
computation expression. The direct refactoring could look something like</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let Run([&lt;OrchestrationTrigger&gt;] context: DurableOrchestrationContext) = async {
  let! hello1 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(&quot;E1_SayHello&quot;, &quot;Tokyo&quot;)   |&gt; Async.AwaitTask
  let! hello2 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(&quot;E1_SayHello&quot;, &quot;Seattle&quot;) |&gt; Async.AwaitTask
  let! hello3 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(&quot;E1_SayHello&quot;, &quot;London&quot;)  |&gt; Async.AwaitTask
  return [hello1; hello2; hello3]
} |&gt; Async.StartAsTask   </code></pre>
<p>That would work for a normal HTTP trigger, but it blows up for the Orchestrator
trigger because multi-threading operations are not allowed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Orchestrator code must never initiate any async operation except by 
using the DurableOrchestrationContext API. The Durable Task Framework 
executes orchestrator code on a single thread and cannot interact with 
any other threads that could be scheduled by other async APIs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To solve this issue, we need to keep working with <code>Task</code> directly. This is
not very handy with standard F# libraries. So, I pulled an extra NuGet
package <code>TaskBuilder.fs</code> which provides a <code>task</code> computation expression.</p>
<p>The above function now looks very simple:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let Run([&lt;OrchestrationTrigger&gt;] context: DurableOrchestrationContext) = task {
  let! hello1 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(&quot;E1_SayHello&quot;, &quot;Tokyo&quot;)
  let! hello2 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(&quot;E1_SayHello&quot;, &quot;Seattle&quot;)
  let! hello3 = context.CallActivityAsync&lt;string&gt;(&quot;E1_SayHello&quot;, &quot;London&quot;)
  return [hello1; hello2; hello3]
}       </code></pre>
<p>And the best part is that it works just fine.</p>
<p><code>SayHello</code> function is Activity trigger based, and no special effort is required
to implement it in F#:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">[&lt;FunctionName(&quot;E1_SayHello&quot;)&gt;]
let SayHello([&lt;ActivityTrigger&gt;] name) =
  sprintf &quot;Hello %s!&quot; name</code></pre>
<h2 id="more-examples">More Examples</h2>
<p>Durable Functions repository comes with 
<a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-durable-extension/tree/master/samples/precompiled">a set of 4 samples</a>
implemented in C#. I took all of those samples and ported them over to F#.</p>
<p>You&#39;ve already seen the first <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/azure-functions-fsharp-examples/blob/master/12-durable/HelloSequence.fs"><code>Hello Sequence</code> sample</a>
above: the orchestrator calls the activity function 3 times and combines the
results. As simple as it looks, the function will actually run 3 times for each
execution, saving state before each subsequent call.</p>
<p>The second <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/azure-functions-fsharp-examples/blob/master/12-durable/BackupSiteContent.fs"><code>Backup Site Content</code> sample</a>
is using this persistence mechanism to run
a potentially slow workflow of copying all files from a given directory to
a backup location. It shows how multiple activities can be executed in
parallel:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let tasks = Array.map (fun f -&gt; backupContext.CallActivityAsync&lt;int64&gt;(&quot;E2_CopyFileToBlob&quot;, f)) files
let! results = Task.WhenAll tasks</code></pre>
<p>The third <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/azure-functions-fsharp-examples/blob/master/12-durable/Counter.fs"><code>Counter</code> example</a>
demos a potentially infinite actor-like workflow, where state can exist and
evolve for indefinite period of time. The key API calls are based on
<code>OrchestrationContext</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let counterState = counterContext.GetInput&lt;int&gt;()
let! command = counterContext.WaitForExternalEvent&lt;string&gt;(&quot;operation&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The final elaborate <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/azure-functions-fsharp-examples/blob/master/12-durable/PhoneVerification.fs"><code>Phone Verification</code> workflow</a>
has several twists, like output binding for activity (<code>ICollector</code> is required
instead of C#&#39;s <code>out</code> parameter), third-party integration (Twilio to send SMSs),
recursive sub-function to loop through several attempts and context-based
timers for reliable timeout implementation.</p>
<p>So, if you happen to be an F# fan, you can still give Durable Functions a try.
Be sure to leave your feedback, so that the library could get even better 
before going GA.</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Azure SQL Database is a managed service that provides low-maintenance SQL Server instances in the cloud.
You don&#39;t have to run and update VMs, or even take backups and setup failover clusters.
Microsoft will do administration for you, you just pay an hourly fee.</p>
<p>So, let&#39;s say you decide this value proposition is a good reason to migrate
away from your existing self-hosted SQL Server database running in production and replace
it with Azure SQL Database.</p>
<p>You do the functional testing and eventually everything works like charm. The next set of questions 
is going to be related to Database performance level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which tier / how many DTU&#39;s should I provision?</li>
<li>How much will it cost?</li>
<li>Will it be able to handle my current production load?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dtus">DTUs</h2>
<p>Even if you collect all the specs of the hardware behind your existing SQL Server, you can&#39;t
directly use that knowledge to choose the right Azure SQL Database size.</p>
<p>The sizes are measured in Database Transaction Units (DTUs). These are abstract units
of measure which don&#39;t necessarily mean much on their own. Within a given tier
(Standard / Premium), doubling the DTU amount will double the max throughput.</p>
<p>That doesn&#39;t really help to plan for workload migrations.</p>
<p>There are some ways to estimate the DTU requirements by measuring metrics like CPU
and IOPS on your existing server. Have a look at <a href="http://dtucalculator.azurewebsites.net/">DTU Calculator</a>:
it consists of a data collector and an online converter from metric values to DTUs.</p>
<p>While useful as a first approximation, I&#39;m reluctant to provision Azure SQL Database 
size solely based on such estimates.</p>
<p>My answer to the problem is: Measure It!</p>
<h2 id="synthetic-tests">Synthetic Tests</h2>
<p>Go get a backup of your existing production database and Export / Import it into
Azure SQL Database. Pick the size based on your gut feel, run a load test, evaluate
the results, adjust the size, repeat.</p>
<p>If you know your workload really well, you can create a synthetic test:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a script or scenario which resembles the real production load</li>
<li>Run it for a given period of time</li>
<li>Measure the DTU&#39;s consumed</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#39;m yet to see a non-trivial database where I could manually create
such script and be reasonably sure that it reflects the reality. Most of the time
the load is consumer-driven, changes over time and heavily depends on exact query
parameter values.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the need of replaying <em>the actual production workload</em> on Azure
SQL Database.</p>
<h2 id="trace-and-replay">Trace and Replay</h2>
<p>SQL Server comes with a marvelous suite of tools refined over years of its existence.
It includes the tools to capture and replay the queries, so I started with those.</p>
<p>SQL Server Profiler has a trace template called <code>TSQL_Replay</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This template records information required to replay the trace. Use this template
to perform iterative turning, such as benchmark testing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounded like what I needed, so I ran the profiler with this template to save
a short trace.</p>
<p>Afterwards, it is possible to use the same SQL Server Profiler to replay the trace against
another target database. So the process looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/02/load-testing-azure-sql-database-by-copying-traffic-from-production-sql-server//sql-trace-replay.png" alt="Replaying Traffic with SQL Server Profiler"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this didn&#39;t go very well:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Azure SQL Database is not supported by the tooling. The replay kind of runs, but
it throws lots of errors like reading from non-existent system tables, trying to
switch between databases and so on </p>
</li>
<li><p>Related or not to the previous item, but replay went terribly slow. It
seemed to slow down exponentially over time</p>
</li>
<li><p>The trace file itself was of huge size. Because the template tries to record pretty
much everything, tracing 5 minutes on production produced 10 GB of XML</p>
</li>
<li><p>Replay was not real-time: you first record, then you replay. This might not be a big
issue for many databases, but some of our queries have time parameter, and results would
change if I replay the trace 1 hour later</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Just to give you a rough idea, our production database-under-study is handling about
1000 RPC calls per second (mostly stored procedures).</p>
<h2 id="custom-trace-replay">Custom Trace &amp; Replay</h2>
<p>Since off-the-shelf solution didn&#39;t work for me, I decided to come up with my own
custom tool chain. Here is the idea:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/02/load-testing-azure-sql-database-by-copying-traffic-from-production-sql-server//sql-trace-replay-event-hubs-functions.png" alt="Replaying Traffic with SQL Server Profiler"></p>
<p>There are two custom steps that I implemented:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Run a console app which would host a custom trace server. The trace server
receives SQL commands and sends them to Azure Event Hubs in batches</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create an Azure Function application triggered by the Event Hub. Each function
call gets one SQL command to execute and runs it against Azure SQL database that
we are trying to load-test</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This setup worked remarkably well for me: I got the real-time replay of SQL commands
from production SQL Server to Azure SQL Database.</p>
<p>The rest of the article describes my setup so that you could reproduce it for your
workload.</p>
<h2 id="azure-sql-database">Azure SQL Database</h2>
<p>Ideally, you want your copy of the database to be as fresh as possible, so that the 
query plans and results match.</p>
<p>Some ideas to accomplish this are given in 
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-cloud-migrate">SQL Server database migration to SQL Database in the cloud</a>.</p>
<p>Premium RS tier is great for testing, because it is much cheaper than Premium
tier, while it provides the same level of performance.</p>
<h2 id="event-hubs">Event Hubs</h2>
<p>I used Azure Event Hubs as messaging middleware between Trace Server and Replay 
Function App.</p>
<p>I started with Azure Storage Queues, but the server wasn&#39;t able to send messages
fast enough, mostly due to lack of batching.</p>
<p>Event Hubs match naturally my choice of Azure Functions: Functions have a built-in
trigger with dynamic scaling out of the box.</p>
<p>So, I just created a new Event Hub via the portal, with 32 partitions allocated.</p>
<h2 id="trace-definition-file">Trace Definition File</h2>
<p>In order to run a custom Trace Server, you still need a trace definition file.
The built-in template <code>TSQL_Replay</code> mentioned above could work, but
it&#39;s subscribed to way too many events and columns.</p>
<p>Instead, I produced my own trace template with minimal selection.
To do that, open SQL Server Profiler, then navigate to <code>File -&gt; Templates -&gt; New Template</code>,
give it a name and then on <code>Events Selection</code> tab exclude everything except
exactly the commands that you want to replay.</p>
<p>We use stored procedures for pretty much everything, so my selection looked
just like this:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/02/load-testing-azure-sql-database-by-copying-traffic-from-production-sql-server//sql-profiler-template.png" alt="SQL Profiler Template"></p>
<p>For the first few runs, I advise you to restrict the trace even further. Click
<code>Column Filters</code> button, select <code>TextData</code> there and set <strong>Like</strong> filter
to a single stored procedure, e.g. matching the pattern <code>%spProductList%</code>.</p>
<p>This way you can debug your whole replay chain without immediately overloading
any part of it with huge stream of commands.</p>
<p>Once done, save the <code>tdf</code> file to disk. An example of such trace definition file
can be found in <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/sql-trace-replay/tree/master/TDF">my github</a>.</p>
<h2 id="trace-server">Trace Server</h2>
<p>My trace server is a simple C# console application.</p>
<p>Create a new console app and reference a NuGet package <code>Microsoft.SqlServer.SqlManagementObjects</code>.
Mine is of version <code>140.17218.0</code> (latest as of today).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this NuGet package is not fully self-contained. In order to run
a profiling session, you have to install SQL Server Profiler tool on the machine
where you want to run the trace server.</p>
<p>Chances are that you already have it there, but be sure to update to the matching
version: mine works with <code>17.4 / 14.0.17213.0</code> but refused to work with older 
versions.</p>
<p>Now we can implement our trace server as a console application. The main
method looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">static void Main(string[] args) // args: &lt;db server name&gt; &lt;db name&gt; &lt;trace file&gt;
{
    // 1. Run trace server
    var connectionInfo = new SqlConnectionInfo(args[0])
    {
        DatabaseName = args[1],
        UseIntegratedSecurity = true
    };
    var trace = new TraceServer();
    trace.InitializeAsReader(connectionInfo, args[2]);

    // 2. Continuously read traces and send them to event hubs
    var tokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
    var readerTask = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt; ReadTrace(trace, tokenSource.Token), tokenSource.Token);
    var senderTask = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =&gt; SendToEventHubs(tokenSource.Token), tokenSource.Token);

    // 3. Stop the trace
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Press any key to stop...&quot;);
    Console.ReadKey();
    tokenSource.Cancel();
    Task.WaitAll(readerTask, senderTask);
}</code></pre>
<p>The first block initializes SQL connection using command line arguments and integrated
security, and then starts the Trace Server.</p>
<p>Because of the large volume, I made trace reader and event sender to work on separate
threads. They talk to each other via a concurrent queue:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">private static readonly ConcurrentQueue&lt;string&gt; eventQueue = new ConcurrentQueue&lt;string&gt;();</code></pre>
<p>Finally, when operator presses any key, the cancellation is requested and the reader and
sender get shut down.</p>
<p>Trace Reader task is a loop crunching though trace data and sending the SQL statements
(with some exclusions) to the concurrent in-memory queue:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">private static void ReadTrace(TraceServer trace, CancellationToken token)
{ 
    while (trace.Read() &amp;&amp; !token.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        var eventClass = trace[&quot;EventClass&quot;].ToString();
        if (string.Compare(eventClass, &quot;RPC:Completed&quot;) == 0)
        {
            var textData = trace[&quot;TextData&quot;].ToString();
            if (!textData.Contains(&quot;sp_reset_connection&quot;)
                &amp;&amp; !textData.Contains(&quot;sp_trace&quot;)
                &amp;&amp; !textData.Contains(&quot;sqlagent&quot;))
            {
                eventQueue.Enqueue(textData);
            }
        }
    }

    trace.Stop();
    trace.Close();
}</code></pre>
<p>Event Sender is dequeueing SQL commands from in-memory queue to collect batches of
events. As soon as a batch fills up, it gets dispatched to Event Hub:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">private static void SendToEventHubs(CancellationToken token)
{
    var client = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(EventHubsConnectionString);
    var batch = client.CreateBatch();
    while (!token.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        if (!eventQueue.TryDequeue(out string sql))
        {
            Thread.Sleep(10);
            continue;
        }

        var eventData = new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sql));
        if (!batch.TryAdd(eventData) &amp;&amp; batch.Count &gt; 0)
        {
            client.SendAsync(batch.ToEnumerable())
                .ContinueWith(OnAsyncMethodFailed, token, TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnFaulted, TaskScheduler.Default);
            batch = client.CreateBatch();
            batch.TryAdd(eventData);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>If your trace doesn&#39;t produce so many messages, you will probably want to periodically send out the batches
even before they get full, just to keep that process closer to real time.</p>
<p>Note that sender does not await <code>SendAsync</code> call. Instead, we only subscribe to failures via <code>OnAsyncMethodFailed</code>
callback to print it to console:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">private static void OnMyAsyncMethodFailed(Task task)
{
    Console.WriteLine(task.Exception?.ToString() ?? &quot;null error&quot;);
}</code></pre>
<p>And that concludes the implementation of the Trace Server. SQL commands now go to Event Hub, to be picked
up by Trace Replay.</p>
<h2 id="trace-replay-function-app">Trace Replay Function App</h2>
<p>To replay those traces against the target Azure SQL Database, I could make another console
application which would contain <code>EventProcessorHost</code> to receive and process SQL commands.</p>
<p>However, under high load a single machine might not be able to keep up with executing all
those commands in real time.</p>
<p>Instead, I decided to distribute such Replay App over multiple machines. To deploy a 
DDoS network, if you will :)</p>
<p>And I don&#39;t have to build, find, configure and synchronize all those servers myself, since we
are living in the world of serverless.</p>
<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/">Azure Functions</a> are the perfect tool for this job. Once you start the trace server,
Function App will start scaling up based on the amount of events in Event Hub, and will
expand until it catches up with the workload.</p>
<p>But as long as you don&#39;t run the trace server, it won&#39;t consume any servers and won&#39;t cost you
a dime. </p>
<p>Here is the implementation of Trace Replay Azure Function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">public static class Replay
{
    [FunctionName(&quot;Replay&quot;)]
    public static void Run(
        [EventHubTrigger(&quot;sqltrace&quot;, Connection = &quot;EventHubsConn&quot;)] string sql,
        TraceWriter log)
    {
        var commandName = sql
            .Split(null)
            .SkipWhile(r =&gt; r != &quot;exec&quot; &amp;&amp; r != &quot;sp_executesql&quot;)
            .FirstOrDefault(r =&gt; !r.Contains(&quot;exec&quot;)) ?? &quot;&lt;empty&gt;&quot;;

        var stopwatch = new Stopwatch();
        stopwatch.Start();

        try
        {
            using (var sqlConnection = new SqlConnection(AzureSqlConnectionString))
            using (var cmd = new SqlCommand())
            {
                sqlConnection.Open();

                cmd.CommandText = sql;
                cmd.CommandType = CommandType.Text;

                cmd.Connection = sqlConnection;

                int count = 0;
                using (var reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())
                {
                    while (reader.Read())
                    {
                        count++;
                    }
                }

                log.Info($&quot;Processed {commandName} in {stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms with {count} rows&quot;);
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            log.Error($&quot;Error in {commandName} in {stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds} {ex.Message}&quot;);
            throw;
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>It&#39;s super simple: the function gets a SQL statement, executes it with <code>SqlCommand</code> class and
logs the result with timing and returned row count. And that&#39;s everything required to start
bombarding my Azure SQL Database.</p>
<h2 id="evaluating-results">Evaluating Results</h2>
<p>The purpose of this whole exercise was to evaluate whether a provisioned DTU level
is enough to stand the load comparable to existing production.</p>
<p>So, after I ran the test, I could browse through the DTU usage chart in Azure portal to
get overall usage statistics.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also spent quite some time analyzing the usage breakdown as reported by <code>sp_BlitzCache</code>
from <a href="https://github.com/BrentOzarULTD/SQL-Server-First-Responder-Kit">Responder Kit</a>. 
Please note that it&#39;s not officially supported for Azure SQL Database, but it seems to work 
reasonably well.</p>
<p>Be sure to re-run your experiments multiple times, at different days and time intervals.</p>
<p>The full code sample can be found in <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/sql-trace-replay/tree/master/TDF">my github</a>.</p>
<p>I hope Azure SQL Database will perform to your expectations and within your budget. But
hope is not a good strategy, so go ahead and try it out!</p>
<p>Happy DDoS-ing!</p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>This post describes a toy application that I&#39;ve built with F# and Azure Functions
in about 1 day of work. It shows a simple end-to-end implementation with some 
useful techniques applied, and can be used as a reference point for anyone interested in
one of the topics mentioned in the title.</p>
<p>The requirements for my application are quite simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement the game of Tic-Tac-Toe for a human player to play against the computer</li>
<li>The field is 3x3, the player to have three-in-a-row wins</li>
<li>After the game, the score is calculated based on the number of moves combined 
with the duration of the game</li>
<li>The history of players&#39; scores is persisted and presented as the leaderboard</li>
</ul>
<p>Below I go through the code step by step. Feel free to jump to the part which interests
you the most:

<p><a name="DomainModelling" href="/2018/01/tictactoe-with-fsharp-azurefunctions-hateoas-and-property-based-testing/undefined"></a></p>
<h2 id="modeling-the-game-with-types">Modeling the Game with Types</h2>
<p>I start with a domain model. The model is composed of immutable F# types (records and discriminated
unions) and pure functions.</p>
<p>We have two players, so we need a type for them:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Player = X | O</code></pre>
<p>In addition, there is a useful function to return the other player based on the given one.
Simple pattern-matching will do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">module Player =
  let other = function | X -&gt; O | O -&gt; X</code></pre>
<p>The domain code is the most important part of the application, so I want it to be covered
by unit tests. Of course, the above function doesn&#39;t really warrant testing, but it&#39;s a nice
and simple way to try out <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/property-based-testing/">Property-Based Testing</a>. 
That is, instead of defining specific tests, we define properties which hold for any valid input.</p>
<p>For <code>other</code> function, I came up with two properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other player is not equal to original player</li>
<li>Other player of other player is the player itself</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the code with <a href="https://github.com/haf/expecto">Expecto</a> and <a href="https://github.com/fscheck/FsCheck">FsCheck</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">testProperty &quot;Other player is not equal to player&quot; &lt;| fun x -&gt;
  Expect.notEqual x (Player.other x) &quot;Other should be different from original&quot;

testProperty &quot;Other player of other player is the player itself&quot; &lt;| fun x -&gt;
  Expect.equal x (Player.other (Player.other x)) &quot;Other other should be equal to original&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Let&#39;s move on to modelling the game. I decided to define a union type to be used for
horizontal and vertical positions of the cells:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Position = One | Two | Three</code></pre>
<p>I could use the normal integers instead, but I don&#39;t want to be worried about validating
the ranges all the time.</p>
<p>My first record type models the move, or action done by a player: it has <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code>
positions of the chosen cell, plus the player information:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type Move = {
  X: Position
  Y: Position
  By: Player
}</code></pre>
<p>The following type <code>RunningGame</code> has just two properties, but its shape defines the
design of the whole application:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type RunningGame = {
  MovesDone: Move list
  PossibleMoves: Move list
}</code></pre>
<p>This type models any state of the game which is not finished yet. </p>
<p><code>MovesDone</code> represents the ordered log of all moves, so we have the complete history 
of actions at any time. Event Sourcing in small.</p>
<p>Equally importantly, there is a list of all possible moves at this point of the game.
I could get away without this property: in the end, it can always be derived from
the history of done moves and 3x3 size of the field.</p>
<p>However, having the list of possible moves simplifies the design of all the decision
maker (client) code:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients don&#39;t have to search for remaining cells based on move log</li>
<li>Validation of a move received from clients gets trivial: just check that it&#39;s in
the list of possible moves</li>
<li>Bot implementation gets easy: it just needs to pick one of the valid moves. The
most trivial bot is a one-liner: it picks a random move from the collection</li>
<li>Tests take advantage of this in a similar way, see <a href="/2018/01/tictactoe-with-fsharp-azurefunctions-hateoas-and-property-based-testing/#PropertyBasedTesting">Game Tests</a> below</li>
<li>We build a nice bridge into HATEOAS-style API, where links provided in the response
correspond to possible moves, see <a href="/2018/01/tictactoe-with-fsharp-azurefunctions-hateoas-and-property-based-testing/#HATEOAS">REST API</a> below</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, we can model a game which is already finished:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type GameOutcome = Won of Player | Tie

type FinishedGame = {
  MovesDone: Move list
  Outcome: GameOutcome
}</code></pre>
<p>Each finished game has a list of moves and the outcome: either one player won, or there
was a tie.</p>
<p>Each state of a game can be described by the union of the previous two states:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type GameState = 
  | Finished of FinishedGame
  | InProgress of RunningGame</code></pre>
<h2 id="modeling-game-flow">Modeling Game Flow</h2>
<p>Now, when all the types are in place, we can model the game flow. The flow is a sequence
of transitions between game states, implemented with pure functions.</p>
<p>First, each game starts at the same state, which is an empty field, and X turn. Here
is the value which represents this initial state:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">module Game =
  let initialState = 
    let positions = [One; Two; Three]
    let cells = seq { 
      for x in positions do
         for y in positions do
            yield { X = x; Y = y; By = X }
      }
    { MovesDone = []; PossibleMoves = List.ofSeq cells }</code></pre>
<p>After each move is made, we need a function to evaluate move outcome: whether current
game is finished or is still in progress. I defined a function <code>evaluate</code> for that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let private evaluate (history: Move list): GameOutcome option = ...</code></pre>
<p>I don&#39;t show the full body here, since it&#39;s quite boring in evaluating rows, columns
and diagonals for three-in-a-row. See the <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/tictactoe/blob/master/TicTacToe/Game.fs#L42-L56">full code</a> 
if you want to.</p>
<p>The following function is even more important: that&#39;s the main domain function called 
<code>makeMove</code>. Its type is <code>RunningGame -&gt; Move -&gt; GameState</code> which perfectly communicates
its intent: given a running game and a move, it returns the game state after the move.
Note that</p>
<ul>
<li>You can&#39;t pass a finished game as an argument, because making a move on finished game
doesn&#39;t make sense</li>
<li>The result <em>can</em> be a finished game</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the function implementation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let makeMove (game: RunningGame) (move: Move): GameState =
  let movesDone = move :: game.MovesDone
  match evaluate movesDone with
  | Some result -&gt; Finished { MovesDone = movesDone; Outcome = result }
  | None -&gt;
    let possibleMoves = 
      List.except [move] game.PossibleMoves
      |&gt; List.map (fun m -&gt; { m with By = Player.other m.By })
    InProgress { MovesDone = movesDone; PossibleMoves = possibleMoves }</code></pre>
<p>It works like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prepend the new move to moves done</li>
<li>Evaluate the game result of these combined moves</li>
<li>If the result is known, return a <code>Finished</code> game with calculated outcome</li>
<li>If the result is not clear yet, return <code>InProgress</code> game with possible
moves same as before, but excluding the move and assigned to the other player</li>
</ul>
<p>Tic-Tic-Toe is two-player game, so I defined another function which runs
a turn of 2 moves by 2 players, given the decision making functions of both
players (so it&#39;s a higher-order function):</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let makeRound player1 player2 gameState =
  let newGameState = player1 gameState |&gt; makeMove gameState
  match newGameState with
  | Finished _ -&gt; newGameState

<h2 id="property-based-testing">Property-Based Testing</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve already shown two simplistic properties for <code>other</code> function.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a bit more challenging to come up with invariant properties when it
comes to testing the game itself. After some brainstorming, I&#39;ve made the
following list:</p>
<ul>
<li>The game is never finished after 4 moves</li>
<li>The game is always finished after 9 moves</li>
<li>X and 0 have to make moves in turns</li>
<li>Player wins by filling one column</li>
<li>Player wins by filling one row</li>
<li>Player wins by filling diagonal</li>
<li>Evaluate a known tie</li>
</ul>
<p>Each property-based test should accept some input from the testing framework.
It should then evaluate the test against this input and assert the invariants.
If the property holds for any possible valid input, the test is green.</p>
<p>I decided to structure my property tests in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each test accepts a list of non-negative integers</li>
<li>Each integer is interpreted as an index of a possible move to select at turn <code>i</code>.
That means that the test receives a sequence which uniquely identifies the moves
to be made</li>
<li>We can restrict this sequence to a scenario under test, e.g. make it less
than 4 moves, or exactly 9 moves, or pick moves from a limited subset of all
possible moves</li>
<li>We apply the moves to calculate the end result</li>
<li>We assert that the result confirms the property under test</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, it&#39;s the responsibility of property based testing framework to generate
all kinds of input lists to try to break our property. If it succeeds, it will
print the exact input which causes the test to fail.</p>
<p>Here is how one such test is implemented.</p>
<p>A helper function plays a sequence of indexes as moves:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let playSequence moves = 
  let playOne s i =
    match s with
    | InProgress p -&gt; Game.makeMove p (p.PossibleMoves.[i % p.PossibleMoves.Length])
    | _ -&gt; s
  List.fold playOne (InProgress Game.initialState) moves</code></pre>
<p>Then the property &quot;The game is always finished after 9 moves&quot; is simply:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">testProp &quot;The game is always finished after 9 moves&quot; &lt;| fun (Gen.ListOf9 xs) -&gt;
  let result = playSequence xs
  Expect.isTrue (Game.isFinished result) &quot;Game should be finished&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Note the restriction <code>Gen.ListOf9 xs</code> that we put on the input sequence. It&#39;s a
generator that I <a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/tictactoe/blob/master/TicTacToe.Tests/Gen.fs#L31-L32">defined</a>, 
so that the list always contains exactly 9 elements.</p>
<p>Other property tests follow a similar pattern, you can see them 
<a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/tictactoe/blob/master/TicTacToe.Tests/GameTests.fs">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rest-api">REST API</h2>
<p>Now, when I&#39;m done with Game domain model, I want to define API that our HTTP
service will expose to the clients. I define my API in REST model.</p>
<p>The main resource is <code>/game</code> resource. To start a new game, a client has to send
<code>POST</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>POST /game
Content-Type: application/json

{ &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Mikhail&quot; }</code></pre><p>And the response body is JSON which denotes a new game created:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5d7b2261&quot;,
    &quot;busyCells&quot;: [],
    &quot;links&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;rel&quot;: &quot;x1y1&quot;,
            &quot;href&quot;: &quot;/game/5d7b2261/move/0&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;rel&quot;: &quot;x1y2&quot;,
            &quot;href&quot;: &quot;/game/5d7b2261/move/1&quot;
        },
        // ... 7 more links follow
    ]
}</code></pre>
<p>The response contains a game ID and the list of occupied cells, empty for now,
because no moves have been made.</p>
<p>More importantly, it contains a list of links, each one of which has a <code>rel</code>
field representing a cell, and a link. The client should <code>POST</code> to this link
if it wants to make a move on the corresponding cell:</p>
<pre><code>POST /game/5d7b2261/move/1</code></pre><p>And the response is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5d7b2261&quot;,
    &quot;result&quot;: null,
    &quot;busyCells&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;x2y3&quot;,
            &quot;value&quot;: &quot;O&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;x1y2&quot;,
            &quot;value&quot;: &quot;X&quot;
        }
    ],
    &quot;links&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;rel&quot;: &quot;x1y1&quot;,
            &quot;href&quot;: &quot;/game/5d7b2261/move/0&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;rel&quot;: &quot;x1y3&quot;,
            &quot;href&quot;: &quot;/game/5d7b2261/move/1&quot;
        },
        // ... 5 more links follow
    ]
}</code></pre>
<p>It has the same structure as before, but now two cells are occupied: one <code>X</code> and one <code>O</code>. The
list of links now has only 7 links, based on the count of free cells.</p>
<p>The client keeps navigating the links until it gets non-empty <code>result</code> field:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;5d7b2261&quot;,
    &quot;result&quot;: &quot;You Win!&quot;,
    &quot;busyCells&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;x3y1&quot;,
            &quot;value&quot;: &quot;X&quot;
        },
        {
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;x3y2&quot;,
            &quot;value&quot;: &quot;O&quot;
        },
        // ... more cells here
    ],
    &quot;links&quot;: [],
    &quot;score&quot;: 401
}</code></pre>
<p>This denotes the end of the game. There&#39;s no more links to navigate, so the client knows it
has to stop playing.</p>
<p>This API is designed in HATEOAS-style (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State). The
clients only need to know the initial URL, while all the other URLs are received from the
previous responses. It resembles the way a human navigates websites.</p>
<p><a name="AzureFunctions" href="/2018/01/tictactoe-with-fsharp-azurefunctions-hateoas-and-property-based-testing/undefined"></a></p>
<h2 id="azure-functions">Azure Functions</h2>
<p>I implemented the above API with Azure Functions. I used .NET Standard based v2 runtime
with precompiled F# functions.</p>
<p>The initial <code>POST /game</code> request is handled by <code>Start</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">type GameRequest = { Name: string }

type Cell = { Name: string; Value: string }
type Link = { Rel:  string; Href:  string }

type GameDTO = {
  Id: string
  Result: string
  BusyCells: Cell list
  Links: Link list
  Score: int
}

[&lt;FunctionName(&quot;Start&quot;)&gt;]
let start([&lt;HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, &quot;POST&quot;, Route = &quot;game&quot;)&gt;] req: GameRequest,
          [&lt;Table(&quot;TicTacToe&quot;)&gt;] store: ICollector&lt;GameEntity&gt;) =
  let gameid = Guid.NewGuid().ToString()
  let state = InProgress Game.initialState
  let serializedState = JsonConvert.SerializeObject state
  store.Add(GameEntity(PartitionKey = &quot;default&quot;, RowKey = gameid, Name = req.Name, State = serializedState))
  ObjectResult(Api.serialize gameid state 0)</code></pre>
<p>The outline of this function:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s triggered by HTTP POST request, as configured for <code>req</code> parameter</li>
<li>The request body is parsed to <code>GameRequest</code> type containing player name</li>
<li>It generates a new game ID</li>
<li>It creates initial game state of empty field</li>
<li>It serializes the state and saves it to Table Storage with <code>store</code> output binding</li>
<li>It returns HTTP body with 
<a href="https://github.com/mikhailshilkov/tictactoe/blob/master/TicTacToe.Functions/Api.fs#L30-L51">serialized</a> game response of type <code>GameDTO</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The second Function <code>Play</code> handles the moves:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">[&lt;FunctionName(&quot;Play&quot;)&gt;]
let play([&lt;HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Anonymous, &quot;POST&quot;, Route = &quot;game/{gameid}/move/{index}&quot;)&gt;] 
         req: HttpRequest, gameid: string, index: int,
         [&lt;Table(&quot;TicTacToe&quot;, &quot;default&quot;, &quot;{gameid}&quot;)&gt;] entity: GameEntity) =
  let state = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;GameState&gt; entity.State
  match state with
  | Finished _ -&gt; BadRequestResult() :&gt; IActionResult
  | InProgress p when index &lt; 0 || index &gt;= p.PossibleMoves.Length -&gt; BadRequestResult() :&gt; IActionResult
  | InProgress p -&gt; 
    let result = Game.makeRound (fun _ -&gt; p.PossibleMoves.[index]) Bot.pickMove p
    entity.State &lt;- JsonConvert.SerializeObject result
    entity.Score &lt;- Scoring.calculateScore (DateTime.UtcNow - entity.StartedAt).TotalMilliseconds result
    ObjectResult(Api.serialize gameid result entity.Score) :&gt; IActionResult</code></pre>
<p>The outline is very similar:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s triggered by a <code>POST</code> request with a URL template containing game ID and move index</li>
<li>It has an in/out Table Storage binding which reads the serialized state saved after previous
game and move requests</li>
<li>It validates the state: if the game is already finished, or if the move index is not in the valid range,
<code>Bad Request</code> HTTP status is returned</li>
<li>If the move is valid, it runs the round, including bot play</li>
<li>It also calculates the score, which is going to be non-zero only for finished games</li>
<li>The game state and the score are saved to Table Storage entity (that&#39;s the only mutation in the whole
application)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bot">Bot</h2>
<p>Azure Function above used a <code>Bot.pickMove</code> function which I haven&#39;t described yet.</p>
<p>This function has the type <code>RunningGame -&gt; Move</code>, exactly what is expected by <code>makeRound</code> game
function. Its goal is to pick the <code>O</code> move for any given game-in-progress.</p>
<p>Obviously, 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe is a very simple game and it&#39;s quite easy to make a perfectly
playing bot. This wasn&#39;t the goal though: it&#39;s more fun for a human to win.</p>
<p>So, actually, the only property test that I ended up implementing is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">testProp &quot;Bot is able to play O at any possible position&quot; &lt;| fun (Gen.ListOfNonNegative xs) -&gt;
  let human i p _ = p.PossibleMoves.[i % p.PossibleMoves.Length]
  let round s i =
    match s with
    | InProgress p -&gt; Game.makeRound (human i p) Bot.pickMove p
    | _ -&gt; s
  List.fold round (InProgress Game.initialState) xs |&gt; ignore     </code></pre>
<p>It makes sure that for any possible sequence of human moves, bot is actually able to make
<em>any</em> move of its own. Bot just shouldn&#39;t crash :)</p>
<p>My very first implementation of the bot was just picking a random move. Such bot is fine,
but it&#39;s too boring to play against.</p>
<p>So, my current bot implementation has 3 rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is a move that immediately wins the game, do that move</li>
<li>If possible, don&#39;t pick a move which leads to immediate loss after the next human move</li>
<li>Otherwise, pick a random move</li>
</ul>
<p>I implemented the bot using the approach described in my 
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2016/07/building-a-poker-bot-functional-fold-as-decision-tree-pattern/">Functional Fold as Decision Tree Pattern</a>
post:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let pickMove (game: RunningGame) = 
  [winNow O; notLoseNow; pickRandom]
  |&gt; Seq.ofList
  |&gt; Seq.choose (fun x -&gt; x game)
  |&gt; Seq.head</code></pre>
<p>So, there is a prioritized list of decision functions. The first one returning <code>Some</code>
decision will be promoted to final decision.</p>
<p>And here are those functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let winNow player (game: RunningGame) =
  let isWin = function | Finished { Outcome = Won x } when x = player -&gt; true | _ -&gt; false
  game.PossibleMoves
  |&gt; List.tryFind (fun move -&gt; Game.makeMove game move |&gt; isWin)

let notLoseNow (game: RunningGame) =
  let canLose = function 
    | InProgress p -&gt; match winNow X p with | Some _ -&gt; true | None -&gt; false
    | _ -&gt; false
  let notLosingMoves =
    game.PossibleMoves
    |&gt; List.filter (fun move -&gt; Game.makeMove game move |&gt; canLose |&gt; not)
  if List.isEmpty notLosingMoves &amp;&amp; notLosingMoves.Length &lt; game.PossibleMoves.Length then None
  else Some (notLosingMoves.[random.Next notLosingMoves.Length])

let pickRandom (game: RunningGame) = 
  Some (game.PossibleMoves.[random.Next game.PossibleMoves.Length])</code></pre>
<p>Such rule-based setup is easy to extend, and also to test when it becomes needed.</p>
<h2 id="score-calculation">Score Calculation</h2>
<p>Last twist to the application is the scoring system. If a human player wins or gets a tie,
they are assigned a numeric score, which can be then compared to the historic leaderboard
of all players.</p>
<p>The score is calculated based on two principles: the less moves you make, and the faster
you play, the higher the score is. Move count is more important than timing.</p>
<p>These principles are nicely expressed as property tests:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">testProp &quot;The score of faster game is not lower than slower game&quot; 
  &lt;| fun (Gen.Positive duration1) (Gen.Positive duration2) game -&gt;
  let (slower, faster) = maxmin id duration1 duration2
  let scoreFaster = Scoring.calculateScore faster game
  let scoreSlower = Scoring.calculateScore slower game
  Expect.isGreaterThanOrEqual scoreFaster scoreSlower &quot;Bigger duration has lower score (or same)&quot;

testProp &quot;The score of won game in less moves is greater than game with more moves&quot; 
  &lt;| fun (Gen.Positive duration1) (Gen.Positive duration2) game1 game2 -&gt;
  let (slower, faster) = maxmin id duration1 duration2
  let (moreMoves, lessMoves) = maxmin List.length game1 game2
  let score1 = Scoring.calculateScore slower (Finished { Outcome = Won X; MovesDone = lessMoves })
  let score2 = Scoring.calculateScore faster (Finished { Outcome = Won X; MovesDone = moreMoves })
  if moreMoves.Length = lessMoves.Length then
    Expect.isGreaterThanOrEqual score1 score2 &quot;Bigger duration has lower score (or same)&quot;
  else
    Expect.isGreaterThan score1 score2 &quot;More moves have lower score&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Note that tests are parameterized for durations and game states. We don&#39;t have to come up with specific
scenarios: the framework should take care of those.</p>
<p>One of the possible implementations for scoring is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let calculateScore duration (state: GameState) =
  let durationScore = (100.0 * (1.0 - duration / (duration + 10000.0))) |&gt; int
  match state with
  | Finished { Outcome = Won X; MovesDone = ms } -&gt; (11 - ms.Length) * 100 + durationScore
  | Finished { Outcome = Tie } -&gt; durationScore
  | _ -&gt; 0</code></pre>
<p>Now, the leaderboard piece. You&#39;ve already seen the bits of this functionality in Azure Functions: 
they store the game state into Azure Table Storage.</p>
<p>There is another Azure Function which handles <code>GET</code> requests to <code>/leaderboard</code> resource. It
loads all the past games from Table Storage, and then passes them to leaderboard calculation
function below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fsharp">let calculateLeaderboard top ns =
  ns
  |&gt; Seq.filter (fun entity -&gt; snd entity &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; not (String.IsNullOrEmpty (fst entity)))
  |&gt; Seq.sortByDescending snd
  |&gt; Seq.truncate top
  |&gt; Seq.mapi (fun index entity -&gt; { Index = index + 1; Name = fst entity; Score = snd entity })</code></pre>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Ok, the application is simple, but the blog post ended up being quite long. Thank you if you
made it so far.</p>
<p>I touched base on several important concepts and tools, which can be useful apart or in
combination.</p>
