    <h1>Azure Functions V2 Is Released, How Performant Is It?</h1>
    

    

    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Azure Functions major version 2.0 was released into GA a few days back during Microsoft Ignite. The runtime is now
based on .NET Core and thus is cross-platform and more interoperable. It has a nice extensibility story too.</p>
<p>In theory, .NET Core runtime is more lean and performant.
But last time <a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers/">I checked back in April</a>,
the preview version of Azure Functions V2 had some serious issues with cold start durations.</p>
<p>I decided to give the new and shiny version another try and ran several benchmarks. All tests were conducted on 
Consumption plan.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: it&#39;s not perfect just yet.</p>
<h2 id="cold-starts">Cold Starts</h2>
<p>Cold starts happen when a new instance handles its first request, see my other posts:
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/04/azure-functions-cold-starts-in-numbers/">one</a>,
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/05/azure-functions-cold-starts-beyond-first-load/">two</a>,
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2018/08/serverless-cold-start-war/">three</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hello-world">Hello World</h3>
<p>The following chart gives a comparison of V1 vs V2 cold starts for the two most popular runtimes:
.NET and Javascript. The dark bar shows the most probable range of values, while the light ones
are possible but less frequent:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/cold-starts-dotnet-js.png" alt="Cold Starts V1 vs V2: .NET and Javascript"></p>
<p>Apparently, V2 is slower to start for both runtimes. V2 on .NET is slower by 10% on average and seems 
to have higher variation. V2 on Javascript is massively slower: 2 times on average, and the slowest startup
time goes above 10 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="dependencies-on-board">Dependencies On Board</h3>
<p>The values for the previous chart were calculated for Hello-World type of functions with no extra dependencies.</p>
<p>The chart below shows two more Javascript functions, this time with a decent number of dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Referencing 3 NPM packages - 5MB zipped</li>
<li>Referencing 38 NPM packages - 35 MB zipped</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/cold-starts-js-dependencies.png" alt="Cold Starts V1 vs V2: Javascript with NPM dependencies"></p>
<p>V2 clearly loses on both samples, but V2-V1 difference seems to be consistently within 2.5-3
seconds for any amount of dependencies.</p>
<p>All the functions were deployed with the Run-from-Package method which promises faster startup times.</p>
<h3 id="java">Java</h3>
<p>Functions V2 come with a preview of a new runtime: Java / JVM. It utilizes the same extensibility model 
as Javascript, and thus it seems to be a first-class citizen now.</p>
<p>Cold starts are not first-class though: </p>
<p><img src="/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/cold-starts-java.png" alt="Cold Starts Java"></p>
<p>If you are a Java developer, be prepared for 20-25 seconds of initial startup time. That will probably 
be resolved when the Java runtime becomes generally available:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That matches some of our internal data. We are looking into it.</p>&mdash; Paul Batum (@paulbatum) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulbatum/status/1048391445386735616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2018</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2 id="queue-processor">Queue Processor</h2>
<p>Cold starts are most problematic for synchronous triggers like HTTP requests. They are less relevant
for queue-based workloads, where scale out is of higher importance.</p>
<p>Last year I ran some tests around the ability of Functions to keep up with variable queue load:
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2017/08/azure-functions-are-they-really-infinitely-scalable-and-elastic/">one</a>,
<a href="https://mikhail.io/2017/12/azure-functions-get-more-scalable-and-elastic/">two</a>.</p>
<p>Today I ran two simple tests to compare the scalability of V1 vs. V2 runtimes.</p>
<h3 id="pause-and-go">Pause-and-Go</h3>
<p>In my first tests, a lightweight Javascript Function processed messages from an Azure Storage Queue. For
each message, it just pauses for 500 msec and then completes. This is supposed to simulate I/O-bound 
Functions.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve sent 100,000 messages to the queue and measured how fast they went away. Batch size (degree of parallelism
on each instance) was set to 16.</p>
<p><img src="/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/queue-scaling-io-based.png" alt="Processing Queue Messages with Lightweight I/O Workload"></p>
<p>Two lines show the queue backlogs of two runtimes, while the bars indicate the number of instances working
in parallel at a given minute.</p>
<p>We see that V2 was a bit faster to complete, probably due to more instances provisioned to it at any moment.
The difference is not big though and might be statistically insignificant.</p>
<h3 id="cpu-at-work">CPU at Work</h3>
<p>Functions in my second experiment are CPU-bound. Each message invokes calculation of a 10-stage Bcrypt
hash. On a very quiet moment, 1 such function call takes about 300-400 ms to complete, consuming 100% CPU 
load on a single core.</p>
<p>Both Functions are precompiled .NET and both are using <a href="https://github.com/BcryptNet/bcrypt.net">Bcrypt.NET</a>.</p>
<p>Batch size (degree of parallelism on each instance) was set to 2 to avoid too much fighting for the same CPU. Yet, 
the average call duration is about 1.5 seconds (3x slower than possible).</p>
<p><img src="/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/queue-scaling-cpu-bound.png" alt="Processing Queue Messages with CPU-bound Workload"></p>
<p>The first thing to notice: it&#39;s the same number of messages with comparable &quot;sequential&quot; execution time, but 
the total time to complete the job increased 3-fold. That&#39;s because the workload is much more demanding to
the resources of application instances, and they struggle to parallelize work more aggressively.</p>
<p>V1 and V2 are again close to each other. One more time, V2 got more instances allocated to it most of the time.
And yet, it seemed to be <em>consistently</em> slower and lost about 2.5 minutes on 25 minutes interval (~10%).</p>
<h2 id="http-scalability">HTTP Scalability</h2>
<p>I ran two similar Functions &mdash; I/O-bound &quot;Pause&quot; (~100 ms) and CPU-bound Bcrypt (9 stages, ~150ms) &mdash; under a stress test.
But this time they were triggered by HTTP requests. Then I compared the results for V1 and V2.</p>
<h3 id="pause-and-go">Pause-and-Go</h3>
<p>The grey bars on the following charts represent the rate of requests sent and processed within a given minute.</p>
<p>The lines are percentiles of response time: green lines for V2 and orange lines for V1.</p>
<p><img src="/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/http-scaling-io-based.png" alt="Processing HTTP Requests with Lightweight I/O Workload"></p>
<p>Yes, you saw it right, my Azure Functions were processing 100,000 messages per minute at peak. That&#39;s a lot of
messages.</p>
<p>Apart from the initial spike at minutes 2 and 3, both versions performed pretty close to each other.</p>
<p>50th percentile is flat close to the theoretic minimum of 100 ms, while the 95th percentile fluctuates a bit, but still
mostly stays quite low. </p>
<p>Note that the response time is measured from the client perspective, not by looking at the statistics provided by Azure.</p>
<h3 id="cpu-fanout">CPU Fanout</h3>
<p>How did CPU-heavy workload perform?</p>
<p>To skip ahead, I must say that the response time increased much more significantly, so my sample clients were
not able to generate request rates of 100k per minute. They &quot;only&quot; did about 48k per minute at peak, which still
seems massive to me.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve run the same test twice: one for Bcrypt implemented in .NET, and one for Javascript.</p>
<p><img src="/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/http-scaling-cpu-bound-dotnet.png" alt="Processing HTTP Requests with .NET CPU-bound Workload"></p>
<p>V2 had a real struggle during the first minute, where response time got terribly slow up to 9 seconds.</p>
<p>Looking at the bold-green 50th percentile, we can see that it&#39;s consistently higher than the orange one throughout
the load growth period of the first 10 minutes. V2 seemed to have a harder time to adjust.</p>
<p>This might be explainable by slower growth of instance count:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/http-scaling-cpu-bound-dotnet-instance-growth.png" alt="Instance Count Growth while Processing HTTP Requests with .NET CPU-bound Workload"></p>
<p>This difference could be totally random, so let&#39;s look at a similar test with Javascript worker. Here is the percentile chart:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/http-scaling-cpu-bound-js.png" alt="Processing HTTP Requests with Javascript CPU-bound Workload"></p>
<p>The original slowness of the first 3 minutes is still there, but after that time V2 and V1 are on-par.</p>
<p>On-par doesn&#39;t sound that great though if you look at the significant edge in the number of allocated instances, in
favor of V2 this time:</p>
<p><img src="/2018/10/azure-functions-v2-released-how-performant-is-it/http-scaling-cpu-bound-js-instance-growth.png" alt="Instance Count Growth while Processing HTTP Requests with Javascript CPU-bound Workload"></p>
<p>Massive 147 instances were crunching Bcrypt hashes in Javascript V2, and that made it a bit faster to respond than V1.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As always, be reluctant to make definite conclusions based on simplistic benchmarks. But I see some trends which might
be true as of today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance of .NET Functions is comparable across two versions of Functions runtimes;</li>
<li>V1 still has a clear edge in the cold start time of Javascript Functions;</li>
<li>V2 is the only option for Java developers, but be prepared to very slow cold starts;</li>
<li>Scale-out characteristics seem to be independent of the runtime version, although there are blurry signs of
V2 being a bit slower to ramp up or slightly more resource hungry.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps in your serverless journey!</p>
